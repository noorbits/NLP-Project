https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/media/dominion-fox-news-allegations/index.html,Here are the Fox broadcasts and tweets Dominion says were defamatory,,,,CNN,"For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.
According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets.
The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.
The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false , saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”
At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “ actual malice ” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.
Fox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.
Here’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.

What they alleged : Election fraud and algorithm flips.
Key false quote : “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.
“That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”
The broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.
What they alleged : Election fraud and Venezuela ties.
Key false quote : “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history.

“Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.
“We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.
“Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/media/fox-dominion-settlement/index.html,"Fox News settles with Dominion for $787 million, averting defamation trial over its 2020 election lies",,,,CNN,"Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility.
Fox News’ $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.
The deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.
“The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin.
The groundbreaking settlement “represents vindication and accountability,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.”
The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.
The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought , though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.
The last-minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.
The witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.
Rupert Murdoch thought the election denialism was “really crazy,” even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump , whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and  “mind-blowingly nuts.”
These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.
“This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,” Fox said in a statement Tuesday. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”
Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.
Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.
The jury selection process wrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didn’t promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.
The racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.
“Your presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important,” Davis said. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.”
Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.
“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.

While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic , another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.
For its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell. They all deny wrongdoing.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/mccarthy-biden-debt-ceiling/index.html,The US economy could depend on McCarthy corralling his extremist Republican troops,,,,CNN,"Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.
The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.
McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.

This is where the risk to Americans comes in. It’s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.
Most countries don’t require the legislature to raise the government’s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.
At least, that’s the way it has worked until now.
McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it’s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.
But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.
Rep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.
“I don’t know what’s in the package completely. That’s the issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.”
It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. “The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We’ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House,” he added. “So we’ll have the first opening offer here. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.”
McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit
In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.
Still, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he’d have the votes to pass his initial bill.
“I think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We’ll get together and work through it.”

His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.
But with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans’ livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy’s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.
So far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP’s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.
“I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?”

Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.
The coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.
There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.
But are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy’s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.
Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office.
In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.
He tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn’t a default but rising national debt.
“Without exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it’s irresponsible,” he said.
Previous fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.
McCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he’s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake.
McCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government’s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default – especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it’s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.
The White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.
“There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.
Republicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.
“President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’t volunteer to get involved.
McCarthy’s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.
As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/kansas-city-ralph-yarl-shooting-tuesday/index.html,The White homeowner accused of shooting a Black teen who rang his doorbell turns himself in and is released on bail,,,,CNN,"The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said.
Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.
Lester turned himself in at a detention center Tuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.
Ralph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has been released from a hospital but faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.
Lester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.
CNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.
The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.
“It’s not as simple as turning a page,” Spoonmore said Tuesday. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.”
But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.
“I share the outrage and concern of many in asking why,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.
“In Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.”
Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.
Lester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was “scared to death” due to the boy’s size, according to the document.
Officers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.
The shooting left Ralph, who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school, with gunshot wounds to his head and arm. While he was hospitalized, Ralph told police he did not pull on the door, according to the document.
It was “nothing short of a miracle” that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.”
The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.
Demonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, “Justice for Ralph,” and calling for the shooter’s arrest.
The shooting also came days before a 20-year-old woman was shot and killed in upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.
Related article A 20-year-old woman was shot and killed after accidentally turning into the wrong driveway in upstate New York, officials say
While Ralph’s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouri’s “stand your ground” law will be cited in Lester’s defense case.
“ Stand your ground ” laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.
Ralph’s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew’s “size” could be a threat.
“I really don’t understand how,” Spoonmore said. “I doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).”
She said she’s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.
“I want justice to look the same across the board,” Spoonmore said. “I want justice to look the same.”
The mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.
“This boy was shot because he was existing while Black,” Lucas said.
Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, “There was a racial component to this case,” but did not elaborate.
On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.
Lester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.
Attorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.
“Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,” Crump told CNN.
“He merely rang the doorbell. That was it,” the teen’s attorney said. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.”
The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. And while he believes race played a role in the shooting, he acknowledged the work by police – including White officers – who helped prosecutors file charges against Lester.
“We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said.
“That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.”
Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.
He then went to his home’s front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door – both of which were locked.
Lester opened the interior door and “saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,” Lester told police.
“He stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door,” the probable cause statement reads.
“He believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in,” the document reads.
Lester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.
Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.
When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.
While the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.
Ralph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, “Don’t come around here,” the document says.  He then went to multiple nearby homes asking for help and telling people to call police.

The boy told police he did not pull on the door, according to the probable cause document.
Responding officers also found the front storm door glass at Lester’s home broken, with blood on the front porch and the driveway, according to the document.
The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states.
A neighbor, who asked not to be identified, told CNN she called 911 after Ralph came to her door, bleeding.
Since the shooter’s location was unknown at the time, she was directed to stay inside her home by the emergency operator for her safety. She said she complied initially, then went outside with towels to help suppress the bleeding.
“This is somebody’s child. I had to clean blood off of my door, off of my railing. That was someone’s child’s blood,” she said. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.”
Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said.
“He and his family are just happy that he’s alive after being shot in the head,” Crump told CNN.
Merritt said Tuesday the first bullet traveled less than five feet into Yarl’s upper temple and penetrated his skull.
“They scraped bullet fragments off his frontal lobe on Thursday. On Saturday he was home playing with his dog,” Merritt said.
He said God was telling the community and its leaders they cannot go on as business usual.
“That was in fact a miracle. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.”
Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page.

“Life looks a lot different right now. Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally. The trauma that he has to endure and survive is unimaginable,” the aunt wrote in the fundraiser.
The GoFundMe page, started to help the family with medical expenses, had garnered more than $2 million in donations by Monday night.
Crump likened Ralph’s shooting to the shootings of 17-year-old Martin in Florida and 25-year-old Arbery in Georgia.
“We continue to fight to say you can’t profile and shoot our children, just because you have this ‘stand your ground’ law,” Crump said. “Unacceptable.”
Merritt told CNN Monday that the “stand your ground” action would not apply to Ralph’s case.
“The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said.
President Joe Biden spoke with Ralph and his mother, Cleo Nagbe, by phone on Monday evening, a White House official told CNN.
Biden also noted how “fortunate” Ralph is that his mother is not just a nurse, but also a physical therapist.
The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.
“The president also committed to keeping up his fight against gun violence,” the official said.

Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service, said a toddler crawled through the fence on the north side of the White House, setting off security alerts.
“The Secret Service Uniformed Division today encountered a curious young visitor along the White House north fence line who briefly entered White House ground,” Gugliemli said. “The White House security systems instantly triggered Secret Service officers and the toddler and parents were quickly reunited.”
It’s not the first time a toddler has crawled through the White House fence. There was a similar incident in 2014 when a toddler squeezed through the White House fence just before then-President Barack Obama was about to address the nation on Iraq.

Jacob Stevens was participating in a TikTok challenge with some friends at home when he ingested the antihistamine, the family donation account states. Jacob was on a ventilator for almost a week before he died, according to WSYX .
CNN has not independently confirmed his cause of death.
Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok .
Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX.
In a statement to CNN, TikTok said, “Our deepest sympathies go out to the family. At TikTok, we strictly prohibit and remove content that promotes dangerous behavior with the safety of our community as a priority. We have never seen this type of content trend on our platform and have blocked searches for years to help discourage copycat behavior. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.”

The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.”
“We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads.
“The challenge, which involves ingestion of excessive quantities of diphenhydramine, is a dangerous trend and should be stopped immediately. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.”
“We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.”
CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment.
The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.”
Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold. It’s safe and effective when used as recommended, the FDA said.
“Diphenhydramine is marketed under the brand-name Benadryl, store brands, and generics. It is also available in combination with pain relievers, fever reducers, and decongestants,” the agency said.
Consumers and parents should store Benadryl and other over-the-counter medications and prescription medicines out of the reach of children, the FDA said.

Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.”
In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. While these tools have potential to change the way people work and create, some have also raised concerns about how they could be use to deceive by impersonating individuals.
Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said.
“Throughout the FTC’s history we have had to adapt our enforcement to changing technology,” said FTC Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.”
FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box.
“Our staff has been consistently saying our unfair and deceptive practices authority applies, our civil rights laws, fair credit, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, those apply,” said Bedoya. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.”
The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations."

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.
Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018.

“Our study suggests poor carbohydrate quality is a leading driver of diet-attributable type 2 diabetes globally,” says senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University and professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston, in a statement.
Another key factor: People are eating far too much red and processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, salami and the like, the study said. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.
In fact, the study estimated 7 out of 10 cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide in 2018 were linked to poor food choices.
“These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter.
Mozaffarian and his team developed a research model of dietary intake between 1990 and 2018 and applied it to 184 countries. Compared with 1990, there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes due to poor diet in 2018, the study found.

Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents.
Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice.
Inadequate intake of five protective dietary factors — fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and yogurt — was responsible for just over 39% of the new cases.

People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet.
Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.
“Our modeling approach does not prove causation, and our findings should be considered as estimates of risk,” the authors wrote."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/health/teen-misuse-adhd-meds-wellness/index.html,ADHD medication abuse in schools is a ‘wake-up call’,,,,CNN,"At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found.
“This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
Related article Prescriptions for ADHD treatments surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, CDC report shows
“In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.”
Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found.
Students also overuse medications or “use a pill that someone gave them due to a sense of stress around academics — they are trying to stay up late and study or finish papers,” said pediatrician Dr. Deepa Camenga, associate director of pediatric programs at the Yale Program in Addiction Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.
“We know this is happening in colleges. A major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools, not just college,” said Camenga, who was not involved with the study.
Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open , the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.
In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools.

Schools with the highest rates of teens using prescribed ADHD medications were about 36% more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year, the study found. Schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue, but it didn’t disappear, McCabe said.
“We know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications, perhaps from family members such as siblings, and asking peers, who may attend other schools,” he said.
Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study.
Schools with more White students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants.
On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis.
In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found.
“But these findings were not being driven solely by teens with ADHD misusing their medications,” McCabe said. “We still found a significant association, even when we excluded students who were never prescribed ADHD therapy.”
Data collection for the study was through 2020. Since then, new statistics show prescriptions for stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most age groups.  At the same time, there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, one of the most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients unable to fill or refill their prescriptions.
The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say.

If overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs, there can be sudden health consequences. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .
Research has also shown people who misuse ADHD medications are highly likely to have multiple substance use disorders .
Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said.
For children with ADHD who use their medications appropriately, stimulants can be effective treatment. They are “protective for the health of a child,” Camenga said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.”
The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed.
“Instead, we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse,” he said. “Parents can make sure the schools their kids  attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.”
Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added.
“You’d be surprised how many kids do not know what to say,” McCabe said. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.”
Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.
“Finally, if parents suspect any type of misuse, they should contact their child’s prescriber right away,” McCabe said. “That child should be screened and assessed immediately.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/clarence-thomas-ethics-democrats/index.html,Democrats bash Justice Clarence Thomas but their plan to investigate ethics allegations is unclear,,,,CNN,"Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow.
Related article Clarence Thomas to amend financial disclosure forms to reflect sale to GOP megadonor
Asked if subpoenas were on the table, Durbin said that no decision has been made on that yet. He said that it was “too soon” to share more information about what his committee’s hearing on Supreme Court ethics might look like. He and other Judiciary Democrats sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts last week calling for him to open an investigation into the Thomas allegations.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.”
“I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said.
Other Democrats on the committee said Tuesday that they were deferring to Durbin, who huddled with Democrats on Monday evening to discuss their strategy towards Thomas.
Meanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united in defending the Thomas, suggesting the court can handle its own affairs.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.”
“The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday.
Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. In recent years, the conservative majority has handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling gun regulations and reining in the powers of executive branch agencies – all prompting outcry from Democrats.
Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary.
“I’m disturbed by the recent reports detailing potentially unethical – even potentially illegal conduct – at the highest levels of our judiciary,” Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing for three lower court nominees on Tuesday. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.”
Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act.
“The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.
Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures.
Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow.
“If the reports are accurate, it stinks,” Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening, in rare comments from a Republican criticizing Thomas’ lack of transparency.
Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 – and said it wasn’t Congress’ place to push an ethics code on the high court.
Related article GOP revolts against plan to replace Feinstein on key panel in push to block Biden judicial picks
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.”
This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases.
Yet Republicans have shown little interest in joining Democrats in using legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices.
“The Court, kind of historically I think, has sort of policed itself,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.”
“Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. “I prefer them to do it internally.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/europe/wagner-commanders-russia-kill-children-intl-hnk/index.html,Two Russians claiming to be former Wagner commanders admit killing children and civilians in Ukraine,,,,CNN,"Two Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time in Ukraine .
The claims were made in video interviews with Gulagu.net, a human rights organization targeting corruption and torture in Russia .
In the video interviews posted online, former Russian convicts Azamat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev – who were both pardoned by Russian presidential decrees last year, according to Gulagu.net – described their actions in Ukraine, during Russia’s invasion.
CNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022.
Uldarov, who appears to have been drinking, details how he shot and killed a five- or six-year-old girl.
“(It was) a management decision. I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said.
According to Gulagu.net, the testimonies were given to founder and Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin over the span of a week. It said Uldarov and Savichev were in Russia when they spoke.

“I want Russia and other nations to know the truth. I don’t want war and bloodshed. You see I’m holding a cigarette in this hand. I followed orders with this hand and killed children,” Uldarov said, describing his motivation for the interview.
The Wagner Group is a Russian private mercenary organization fighting in Ukraine, headed by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin .
It has recruited tens of thousands of fighters from Russian jails, offering freedom and cash after a six-month tour. It’s estimated by Western intelligence officials and prison advocacy groups that between 40,000 and 50,000 men were recruited.
Uldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut – which have seen some of the fiercest fighting – Wagner mercenaries “were given the command to annihilate everyone.”
“There is a superior over all the commanders – it’s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,” he added. CNN has previously reported on former Wagner fighters making similar claims.
Uldarov has since appeared to recant his account in a video call with Prigozhin-linked Russian news agency RIA-FAN.
At one point in the interview, Savichev described how they “got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.”
He also talked about getting orders to ‘sweep’ a house. “It doesn’t matter whether there is a civilian there or not. The house needs to be swept. I didn’t give a f**k who was inside,” he said.
“Whether a hut or a house, the point was to make sure that there wasn’t a single living person left inside,” he said. “You can condemn me for this. I will not object. It’s your right. But I wanted to live, too.”
Related article Opinion: How the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russia's 'meat-grinder'
Savichev said Wagner fighters who did not follow orders were killed.
Wagner Group chief Prigozhin confirmed on his Telegram channel that he had watched parts of the video, and threatened retribution against the two former Wagner fighters. “As for what (Osechkin) filmed, I looked at the pieces of video I managed to see,” he said. “I can say the following: if at least one of these accusations against me is confirmed, I am ready to be held accountable according to any laws.”
But Prigozhin said that “if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a ‘fair trial,’ so to speak.”
“They will not be “civilians” for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. This is a flagrant lie. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.”
Earlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: “Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.”
Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable.
“Russian terrorists confessed to numerous murders of Ukrainian children in Bakhmut and Soledar. Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be. How many more crimes like these have been committed?” he said.
In February, CNN spoke to two former Wagner fighters who described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. Deserters, or those who refuse orders are killed and there was no evacuation of the wounded, they said.
In January, US Treasury Department designated Wagner Group as a significant transnational criminal organization , and imposed a slew of fresh sanctions on a transnational network that supports it.
The US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to “target a range of Wagner’s key infrastructure – including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies,” according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/schumer-senate-feinstein-vote-cardin/index.html,GOP blocks Democratic effort to replace Feinstein on Judiciary panel,,,,CNN,"Republicans on Tuesday formally blocked a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee, something Democrats hoped to do in order to advance stalled judicial nominations.
Senate Democrats are seeking to temporarily replace Feinstein on the powerful panel that processes judicial nominees as the California Democrat remains absent, recovering from shingles.
Senate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly.
Feinstein’s return date is still unclear and she asked just last week to be “temporarily” replaced on the committee as she recovers.
Schumer introduced his motion on Tuesday by talking about his friendship with Feinstein, and highlighting her accomplishments.
“Today, I am acting not just as Leader but as Dianne’s friend, in honoring her wishes, until she returns to the Senate,” Schumer said.
GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to Schumer’s request, though he also praised the California Democrat. He argued that Schumer’s move is to get more judges confirmed.
“She’s a dear friend and we hope for her speedy recovery and return back to the Senate. With all due respect, my colleague, Senator Schumer, this is about a handful of judges that you can’t get the votes for,” Graham said.
Democrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it’s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success.
Feinstein, who has already announced she’s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington “by the end of the March work period,” but that her return got “delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.”
She recently said she plans to return “as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel.”
Cardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein.
The Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she’s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns.
“I recognize the importance of the numbers on the committee, and this way we can be able to conduct business. I look at this as a way of dealing with a current situation,” Cardin said.
Democrats would need 60 votes to replace Feinstein on the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Feinstein does not return soon, at least 12 nominees, or possibly even more, could be stalled.
If Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted – both on the committee and on the Senate floor.
Asked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can’t return by May, Schumer responded that he’s “hopeful” she will return “very soon.”
“Look, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,” Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol.
Feinstein announced in February that she would not run for reelection, and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary.
Many congressional Democrats have remained largely supportive of her decision to remain in office while absent from the Capitol as she recovers from shingles.
But Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats – and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin recently acknowledged to CNN that Feinstein’s absence had slowed down the party’s push to confirm nominees. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that “the rain can fall on both sides of the road.”
Asked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time.
Republican Sen. John Cornyn, a senior member on the Judiciary Committee and close adviser to McConnell, told CNN that he opposes the effort to replace Feinstein on the panel.
“I don’t think Republicans can or should help President Biden’s most controversial nominees,” the Texas Republican said. “I support having Sen. Feinstein come back as soon as she can. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don’t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.”

The McCurtain Gazette-News over the weekend published the audio it said was recorded following a Board of Commissioners meeting on March 6.
The paper said the audio of the meeting was legally obtained, but the McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that it was illegally recorded and is investigating. The sheriff’s office also said it believes the recording had been altered.
“I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement Sunday. “There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place,” the statement said.
The governor called for the immediate resignations of McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, District 2 Commissioner Mark Jennings, sheriff’s investigator Alicia Manning and jail administrator Larry Hendrix. He also said he would ask the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.
McCurtain County is in southeastern Oklahoma, about 200 miles from Oklahoma City.
The recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff’s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported.
In the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper’s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the Oklahoman reported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News.
According to the Oklahoman report, Jennings said, “Oh, you’re talking about you can’t control yourself?” and Manning replied: “Yeah, I ain’t worried about what he’s gonna do to me. I’m worried about what I might do to him. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper … if my daddy hadn’t been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.”
Jennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and “started to go down there and just kill him,” according to the Gazette-News.

“I know where two big, deep holes are here if you ever need them,” Jennings allegedly said. Clardy, the sheriff, allegedly said he had the equipment.
“I’ve got an excavator,” Clardy is accused of saying during the discussion. “Well, these are already pre-dug,” Jennings allegedly said.
In other parts of the recording, officials expressed disappointment that Black people could no longer be lynched, according to the paper.
CNN has not been able to verify the authenticity of the recording or confirm who said what. CNN has reached out to all four county officials for comment.
The Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Association voted Tuesday to suspend the membership of Clardy, Manning and Hendrix, the group’s executive director told CNN.
Willingham and his father, Bruce Willingham, the paper’s publisher, have been advised to temporarily leave town, CNN affiliate KJRH reported.
“For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,” Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement.
The McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Monday that there is an “ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations” of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it “illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.” It also said the recording has yet to be “duly authenticated or validated.”
“Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered. The motivation for doing so remains unclear at this point. That matter is actively being investigated,” the statement said.
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office has received an audio recording and is investigating, Communications Director Phil Bacharach said.
The FBI wouldn’t confirm or deny whether it was involved in the investigation, with spokesperson Kayla McCleery saying it is agency policy not to comment.

In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.”
Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests.
The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. The plant has frequently been disconnected from Ukraine’s power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.
While the plant is still physically operated by Ukrainian staff, Rosatom manages it. The Energy Department warned Rosatom in the letter that it is “unlawful” for any Russian citizens or entities to handle the US technology.
CNN has reached out to Rosatom for comment.
“It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.”
It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. The Energy Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration told CNN in a statement that the letter is authentic.
The letters were first reported by the news outlet RBC Ukraine.
“The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration.
She added: “The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorizing the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.”
Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.”
The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misattributed the news outlet that first reported the letters. It was RBC Ukraine."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/health/fda-bivalent-booster-additional-doses/index.html,FDA clears the way for additional bivalent boosters for certain vulnerable individuals,,,,CNN,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration amended the terms of its emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines on Tuesday, allowing people ages 65 and older and certain people with weakened immunity to get additional doses before this fall’s vaccination campaigns.
The bivalent vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna carry instructions for fighting both the original strain of the Covid-19 virus as well as Omicron and its spinoffs.
They have been available in the United States since September under emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, which tightly restrict how the vaccines may be given.
On Tuesday, the FDA changed the terms of the authorizations for those vaccines so that certain individuals could get an additional dose ahead of most others.
Related article WHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk
Namely, adults ages 65 and older who have received a single dose of a bivalent vaccine may receive an additional dose at least four months following their first dose.
Most individuals with certain degrees of immunocompromise who have received a first dose of a bivalent vaccine can get a second at least 2 months later.  Additional doses may be administered at the discretion of their healthcare provider.
Dr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, has been calling on the FDA to increase access to the bivalent boosters for those who want them.  He says for the most part, today’s guidance from the agency makes sense.
“My only question is why the 65 year age cutoff? What was that based on? Ordinarily I would have preferred that it be brought down to 60 or even 50,” Hotez said in an email to CNN.
“For those Americans who understand its importance, we should make second bivalent boosters available. Finally, we’ll soon need guidance about another annual fall booster. Presumably that information comes sometime this summer,” he added.
For immunocompromised children ages 6 months through 4 years, eligibility for additional bivalent doses will depend on the vaccine previously received, the FDA said in a news release.
Another big change is that most unvaccinated individuals may now receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine, rather than mutiple doses of the original single-strain vaccines, the agency said.  The FDA simplified its recommendation for unvaccinated individuals after recognizing that most Americans now have some immunity against Covid-19, even if its just through past infections.
“Evidence is now available that most of the U.S. population 5 years of age and older has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, either from vaccination or infection that can serve as a foundation for the protection provided by the bivalent vaccines. COVID-19 continues to be a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider staying current with vaccination, including with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. The available data continue to demonstrate that vaccines prevent the most serious outcomes of COVID-19, which are severe illness, hospitalization, and death,” said Dr. Peter Marks, head of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a news release .

Children ages 6 months through 5 years who have not yet been vaccinated may now receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine as their primary series, or a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine if they are 6 months through 4 years of age.  Children who are age 5 may receive two doses of the Moderna bivalent or a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine.
Children ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses they’ve already had and what kind of vaccine they got.
The agency stressed that most people who have gotten one dose of a bivalent vaccine are not currently eligible for a second dose.
And they encouraged everyone who hasn’t yet gotten their first dose of a bivalent vaccine to do so, and many Americans are still in that bucket.
Only about 17% of those eligible, less than 1 in 5 Americans, has gotten a recommended dose.
As time has passed, adults with reduced immune function because of their age or an underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose of the bivalent vaccines.
The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane.
But the agency has not been free to make what’s known as a “permissive use” recommendation about the boosters, which would allow doctors to offer additional doses to vulnerable patients because of the terms of the EUA.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
The updated terms give the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) greater freedom to recommend additional doses of the bivalent vaccines. The ACIP is holding a meeting on the Covid-19 vaccines Wednesday and is expected to endorse the FDA’s changes.
For everyone not covered by today’s changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.
Both Canada and the United Kingdom have offered another round of bivalent boosters to those at highest risk from Covid-19 this spring."

Authorities are also investigating highway shootings they say are connected | CNN,,,,CNN,"A 34-year-old man was arrested Tuesday evening in connection with the killings of four people who were found dead earlier in the day at a Bowdoin, Maine, home, authorities said.
The killings appeared to be connected to a series of nearby highway shootings that left three drivers injured – including one critically – shortly after the four bodies were discovered, state police have said.
The man arrested was identified by Maine State Police as Joseph Eaton.
Eaton was taken to Two Bridges Regional Jail and will make an initial court appearance later in the week, state police said in a Tuesday evening news release. State police did not say as of late Tuesday night that he was being held in connection with the highway shootings.
CNN has not yet been able to identify an attorney for Eaton.
“Investigators will be working throughout the night processing multiple scenes and continuing to interview people involved with this incident,” state police said in the news release.
Police have not shared details about a possible motive in the two incidents and did not share details about the four people found dead in the home.
In a statement on Twitter, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said, “Like people across Maine, I am shocked and deeply saddened – acts of violence like we experienced today shake our state and our communities to the core.”
Maine State Police responded Tuesday morning to the Bowdoin home, where they found the four deceased victims inside, state police Lt. Randall Keaten said in a news conference earlier Tuesday.
Shortly after, authorities received reports of several vehicles getting hit by gunfire on I-295 in the area of Yarmouth, which is about 40 minutes from Bowdoin.
Three people were shot while driving and were taken to the hospital, state police said. At least one of those three was in critical condition Tuesday, authorities added.
“We’ve got vehicles that have been hit by straight gunfire all across that we’re getting reports on, so if anybody has holes in their vehicles, please contact us so that we can follow up with that,” Keaten said.
The victims found in the Bowdoin home and the highway shootings are connected, Keaten said, adding there is no threat to the public.
The four bodies were taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Augusta where autopsies will determine the manner and cause of death state police said.
Authorities have asked anyone who may have witnessed something or has any information about the Tuesday morning incidents to reach out.
“A lot happened this morning between those two scenes and those are the people that we want to talk to, those people that were impacted by this,” Keaten said, adding authorities were continuing to work on several impacted scenes and gather more information.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/sport/damar-hamlin-cleared-to-train-nfl-spt-intl/index.html,Damar Hamlin cleared to resume football activities after January cardiac arrest,,,,CNN,"Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin , who has been cleared to resume football activities, said Tuesday his cardiac arrest during an NFL game in January was caused by commotio cordis .
Hamlin went into cardiac arrest after making a tackle and appearing to be hit with a helmet in his chest during the first quarter of the Bills’ game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.
Commotio cordis can occur when severe trauma to the chest disrupts the heart’s electrical charge and causes dangerous fibrillations.
“I died on national TV in front of the whole world,” Hamlin said in his first session with reporters since the injury. “I lost a bunch of people in my life. I know a bunch of people who lost people in their lives. I know that feeling. That right there is the biggest blessing of it all – for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.”
The 25-year-old has been at the Bills’ practice facility in Orchard Park, New York, participating in voluntary offseason workouts this week, according to the team.
“He is fully cleared,” Bills General Manager Brandon Beane told reporters. “He’s here.”
Hamlin said he was blessed to have a wonderful medical staff who “treat me with the care of their children.”
The safety said his heart is still in the game and he was announcing his comeback to the NFL.
“I just want to show people that fear is a choice. You can keep going at something without having the answers and without knowing what’s at the end of the tunnel,” he said. “You might feel anxious – you might feel any type of way – but you just keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going. I want to stand for that.”
Beane said that Hamlin had seen three separate specialists over the offseason, who all agreed that the player “is clear to resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.”
“(Hamlin’s) in a great headspace to come back and make his return,” Beane added.
Bills head coach Sean McDermott said the team is happy that Hamlin is back.
“We’re super excited for Damar. He’s moving forward one step at a time here. He’s been cleared from a physical standpoint,” McDermott said.
“We’ll provide all of the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint so just happy for him that he’s been able to check some of those boxes to this point and we’re moving forward taking it one day at a time.”
According to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, if no underlying cardiac abnormalities are discovered through testing, athletes who have been resuscitated from commotio cordis may return to playing.
Hamlin likely went through a lot of tests, including electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, before doctors cleared him to return to training.
“What it basically means a few things. One is that his heart function returned to normal. He has no underlying problems with the anatomy of the heart itself, and he has no underlying electrical problems, so that’s the most important thing –  and the way they figured that out over the last three-and-a-half months was to do a lot of tests,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on “CNN News Central.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/gilday-defends-non-binary-sailor/index.html,Top US Navy admiral Michael Gilday defends non-binary sailor amid some Republican criticism,,,,CNN,"The top US Navy admiral ardently defended a non-binary sailor on Tuesday amid some criticism from Republican lawmakers, saying he is “particularly proud of this sailor.”
The sailor, LTJG Audrey Knutson, had their story shared on the Navy’s Instagram page last week. In a short video, Knutson said they are proud to serve as non-binary, especially because their grandfather served in the Navy as a gay man in World War II. During a deployment last fall aboard the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, Knutson said their highlight was reading a poem to the whole ship at an LGBTQ spoken word night. The Instagram video garnered nearly 17,000 likes.
Subsequently, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted a portion of the clip with the caption, “While China prepares for war, this is what they have our US Navy focused on.” On Tuesday, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, continued attacking the video, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee he had “a lot of problems with the video.”
But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday defended the sailor, emphasizing that it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a warfighting team.
“I’ll tell you why I’m particularly proud of this sailor,” Gilday told the hearing. “So, her grandfather served during World War II, and he was gay and he was ostracized in the very institution that she not only joined and is proud to be a part of, but she volunteered to deploy on Ford and she’ll likely deploy again next month when Ford goes back to sea.”
Gilday used female pronouns to refer to Knutson but the Navy told CNN Knutson’s pronouns of choice are non-binary.
“We ask people from all over the country, from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds to join us,” Gilday said, “and then it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a cohesive warfighting team that’s going to follow the law, and the law requires that we be able to conduct prompt, sustained operations at sea. That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so … if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I’m proud to serve beside them.”
Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too “woke,” claiming it has been one of the causes of the military’s poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about “wokeness.”
Last month, Republican Rep. Cory Mills and several others went after the Defense Department on its diversity, equity and inclusion training at a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing on military personnel. Mills said, “We absolutely 150% can out-pronoun every single one of our adversaries, and China and Russia I’m sure are quaking in their boots over this.”
In response, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros said diversity and equal opportunity training have been a part of the military for decades.
At another hearing in early-March with the military’s top enlisted leaders, Sgt. Maj. Of the Army Michael Grinston stressed that the military’s focus remains on combat lethality, even with additional training on diversity and inclusion.
“There is one hour of equal opportunity training in basic training, and 92 hours of rifle marksmanship training,” Grinston said at the time. “And if you go to [One Station Unit Training], there is 165 hours of rifle marksmanship training and still only one hour of equal opportunity training.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/fulton-county-trump-fake-electors/index.html,Fulton County DA says fake Trump electors are incriminating one another,,,,CNN,"The Fulton County District Attorney’s office said some fake electors for Donald Trump have implicated each other in potential criminal activity and is seeking to disqualify their lawyer, according to a new court filing.
The district attorney’s office is requesting that attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow be disqualified from representing a group of 10 Republicans who served as electors for the former president in Georgia – a state Trump lost to President Joe Biden. The DA’s office also accused the lawyer of failing to present an immunity deal to her clients last year, according to the filing.
The new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were “imminent.”
Related article Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp urges Republicans to move on from election fraud claims: '2020 is ancient history'
It notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.
“The statement of some of her clients that directly implicate another client in additional crimes shows that Ms. Debrow’s continued participation in this matter is fraught with conflicts of interest that rise to the level of her being disqualified from this case in its entirety,” the district attorney’s office wrote in the filing.
During the April 2023 interviews, “some of the electors stated that another elector represented by Ms. Debrow committed acts that are violations of Georgia law and that they were not party to these additional acts,” according to the filing.
Amid a fight last year to compel the fake electors to testify, the court instructed two attorneys, including Debrow, to inform their clients with potential immunity deals. The attorneys told the court that they spoke to their clients and none of the clients were interested, according to filing. Now the DA’s office is claiming those offers were never presented to the clients.
“Additionally, in these interviews, some of the electors represented by Ms. Debrow told members of the investigation team that no potential offer of immunity was ever brought to them in 2022,” the filing states.
Debrow slammed the latest motion in a statement.
“The DA’s Motion is baseless, false, and offensive,” Debrow said. “None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.”
No one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people – including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – were informed they were potential targets of Willis’s probe.
A special grand jury investigating the matter concluded its work late last year and recommended more than a dozen people should face charges, the foreperson for the panel said in interviews.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/success/tax-day-2023-file-irs/index.html,Tax Day: Here’s what you need to know if you haven’t filed your return yet - and even if you have,,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of a story that originally ran on April 14, 2023.
It’s April 18, the official deadline to file your federal and state income tax returns for 2022. (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.)
Whether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic.
“This is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters.
For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.
The agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added.
Those online tools may be especially helpful today if you are scrambling to get your return in before midnight. Or, if you’ve come to the realization that you need to file for an extension. Either way, here are some key things to know:
Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.
Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.
If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.

Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit . (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.
Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.
Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:
Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).
If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.
Here are some of the tax forms you may have received:
“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.
One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.
Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer .
Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.
What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.

Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.
So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today.
You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.
Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.
If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.
You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee . Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.
If you can’t pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have some payment plan options . But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance.
If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.
Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “ interactive tax assistant ” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.
If you’ve already filed your return, you’re probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about what’s ahead.
What about my refund? If you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, it may be smaller than last year, even if your financial life didn’t change much. That’s because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired.
So far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last year’s filing season.
Will I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low.
For filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million.
Looking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-cec/index.html,"Undocumented immigrants are paying their taxes today, too",,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first published in 2019.
It’s a surprising fact that’s often overlooked in the immigration debate.
Undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in federal taxes annually, between tax returns filed and taxes deducted from paychecks, experts estimate.
Here’s a look at why – and how – this is happening.
The National Immigration Law Center breaks down a number of reasons why undocumented immigrants pay taxes , including:
• It shows they’re complying with federal tax laws.
• It can help them demonstrate “good moral character” if they later have an opportunity to legalize their immigration status.
• Tax return records could be used to document work history and presence in the US, steps that may help them be eligible for legal immigration status in the future if lawmakers pass immigration reform.
Critics of illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are able to do so because they’re using stolen Social Security numbers. But millions of federal tax dollars are paid every year by people who don’t have Social Security numbers at all.

Instead, they file using what’s known as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).
The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, notes that “most experts believe the vast majority of tax returns filed with ITINs today are filed by undocumented immigrants.”
Some noncitizens who legally immigrated to the United States also pay taxes using this method.
In 2019, according to the IRS , more than 2.5 million tax returns were filed using ITINs, accounting for nearly $6 billion in taxes.
In addition to tax return filings, officials estimate that undocumented immigrants also contribute billions to Social Security annually through payroll tax deductions. In 2010, for example, the Social Security Administration estimated that payments from unauthorized workers accounted for about $12 billion in tax revenue for Social Security.
In recent years, immigrant rights advocates’ posts on Facebook, Twitter and TikTok during tax season have drawn attention to the issue.
“Undocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes to fund programs they can’t access,” the National immigration Law Center wrote in a series of recent social media posts.
In 2017, Belén Sisa’s post about her experience paying taxes went viral.
“Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday?” wrote Sisa, who was a college student in Arizona at the time.

The beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program later told CNN she felt it was important to speak out.
“I wanted to show people that we’re here, and that we come from all over the world, and that we contribute more than people think that we do,” she said.
Jose Antonio Vargas , the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist who’s turned his struggles as an undocumented immigrant into a platform for advocacy, took a break from finalizing his taxes in 2019 to share his experience on Twitter .
“Yes,” he wrote, “undocumented immigrants are helping fund the very systems that detain and deport us.”"

Tuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. But for many of the nation’s wealthiest, it’s just another Tuesday.
Tax Day isn’t just a filing deadline — it’s also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. For us, the loopholes are bigger and the rates are sometimes lower. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer, with the wealth of billionaires in particular growing by more than $1.5 trillion over the last few years.
This status quo is unfair, but even more importantly, it’s unsustainable. Such high levels of inequality are pushing our economy and our democracy to their breaking points. That’s why we should examine how we can set our country up for long-term stability and prosperity. And we should start by ensuring that the ultra-rich pay more of what they owe the country that made their success possible.
There are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that:
Right now, the US tax system values money over sweat. If you work hard for your money instead of earning it passively, you’re essentially penalized for it. People who earn a salary pay significantly higher tax rates on their income than wealthy investors who passively earn capital gains income.
Inheriting money is an even better deal. Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law , the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax , and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. With this, it becomes relatively simple for the rich to inherit tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars, and pay almost nothing in taxes. Someone working for that money, on the other hand, would pay over a third of it in federal income taxes.
Related article Opinion: The hard lessons I learned the first time I was laid off
Why do we have a tax code that says working people should be taxed more than wealthy investors and those who got rich just by virtue of being born into the right family? At the end of the day, money is money, whether you worked for it or whether you inherited it. As an heiress and an investor, we should not be paying lower tax rates than people who earn their money from working.
It’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income.
We can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. Capital gains are only taxed when assets are sold, so instead of selling them, the ultra-rich use their assets as collateral to borrow vast sums of money at extremely low interest rates to live on, and then declare little or even negative “income” on their tax forms. This “ Buy, Borrow, Die ” strategy is a major reason billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate over recent years than working-class families.
By rethinking what is taxable, we can get access to the trillions of dollars of billionaire wealth that is untouchable under our current tax structure. That’s why President Biden has proposed the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax , which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires.
Finally, one of the most straightforward changes needed is to simply tax the extremely rich more than the merely rich. Our income tax caps out at a top rate of 37% for any income over $578,125 (or $693,750 for married couples). No matter how much more someone makes, they’ll never pay more than 37% in federal income taxes.
While someone earning $600,000 is certainly making enough to live a very comfortable life, they’re in a different world than someone making $600 million a year. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the top rates we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. They should reach up to 90% for people making more than $100 million a year.
These three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable. The tax code can be a powerful tool for both social and economic change. We just need to use it more effectively."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/economy/china-gdp-q1-2023-intl-hnk/index.html,China GDP: Economy shakes off Covid legacy to grow 4.5% in Q1,,,,CNN,"China’s economy got off to a solid start in 2023, as consumers went on a spending spree after three years of strict pandemic restrictions ended.
Gross domestic product grew by 4.5% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. That beat the estimate of 4% growth from a Reuters poll of economists.
But private investment barely budged and youth unemployment surged to the second highest level on record, indicating the country’s private sector employers are still wary about longer term prospects .
Consumption posted the strongest rebound. Retail sales jumped 10.6% in March from a year earlier, the highest level of growth since June 2021. In the January to March months, retail sales grew 5.8%, mainly lifted by a surge in revenue from the catering service industry.
“The combination of a steady uptick in consumer confidence as well as the still-incomplete release of pent-up demand suggest to us that the consumer-led recovery still has room to run,” said Louise Loo, China lead economist for Oxford Economics.
Industrial production also showed a steady increase. It was up 3.9% in March, compared with 2.4% in the January-to-February period. (China usually combines its economic data for January and February to account for the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday.)
Last year, GDP expanded by just 3%, badly missing the official growth target of “around 5.5%,” as Beijing’s approach to stamping out the coronavirus wreaked havoc on supply chains and hammered consumer spending.
After mass street protests gripped the country and local governments ran out of cash to pay huge Covid bills, authorities finally scrapped the zero-Covid policy in December. Following a brief period of disruption due to a Covid surge, the economy has started showing signs of recovery.
Last month, an official gauge of non-manufacturing activity jumped to its highest level in more than a decade, suggesting the country’s crucial services sector was benefiting from a resurgence in consumer spending after the end of pandemic restrictions.
As the economic recovery gains traction, investment banks and international organizations have upgraded China’s growth forecasts for this year. In its World Economic Outlook released last week, the International Monetary Fund said China is “rebounding strongly” following the reopening of its economy. The country’s GDP will grow 5.2% this year and 5.1% in 2024, it predicted.
However, some analysts believe the strong growth reported in the first quarter was the product of “backloading” of economic activity from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was weighed down by pandemic restrictions and then a chaotic reopening.
“Our core view is that China’s economy is deflationary,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, in a Tuesday research report.
If adjustments are made to account for the impact of delayed economic activity, GDP growth in the first quarter could have been just 2.6%, he said.
Some key data released on Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment was extremely weak.
Fixed asset investment by the private sector increased a mere 0.6% from January to March, indicating a lack of confidence among entrepreneurs. (State-led investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) That’s even worse than the 0.8% growth recorded in the January-to-February period.
The Chinese government has resorted to surprising measures to restore confidence among private entrepreneurs, but the campaign has inspired more nervousness than optimism.

The all-important property industry is also mired in a deep downturn. Investment in property declined 5.8% in the first quarter. Property sales by floor area decreased by 1.8%.
“The domestic economy is recovering well, but the constraints of insufficient demand are still obvious,” said Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the NBS, at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. “Prices of industrial products are still falling, and enterprises are facing many difficulties in their profitability.”
Unemployment continued to surge among the youth.
The jobless rate for 16- to 24-year-olds hit 19.6% in March, up for a third straight month. It was the second highest on record, only behind the 19.9% level reached in July 2022.
The high jobless rate among the youth suggests “slack in the economy,” Yeung said.

“By June, there will be a new batch of graduates looking for jobs. The jobless condition could worsen further if China’s economic momentum falters,” he added.
China’s education ministry has previously estimated that a record 11.6 million college graduates will be looking for jobs this year.
At last month’s meeting of the National People’s Congress, the country’s rubber-stamp parliament, the government set a cautious growth plan for this year, with a GDP target of around 5% and a job creation target of 12 million."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/success/husbands-wives-earning-division-of-labor-pew-survey/index.html,"More women now make as much as their husbands, but still do more at home",,,,CNN,"Few women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure.
“Even as financial contributions have become more equal in marriages, the way couples divide their time between paid work and home life remains unbalanced,” Pew noted.
So who’s earning what?
Pew found that in 29% of heterosexual marriages today, women and men earn about the same (roughly $60,000 each). “Husbands in egalitarian marriages spend about 3.5 hours more per week on leisure activities than wives do. Wives in these marriages spend roughly 2 hours more per week on caregiving than husbands do and about 2.5 hours more on housework,” the study notes.
In 55% of opposite-sex marriages, men are the primary or sole breadwinners, earning a median of $96,000 to their wives’ $30,000.

Meanwhile, in 16% of marriages the wives outearn their husbands as the primary (10%) or sole breadwinner (6%). In these marriages women earn a median of $88,000 to their husbands’ $35,000.
Of all of these categories, the only one in which men are reported to spend more time caregiving than their wives is when the woman is the sole breadwinner. And the time spent per week on household chores in those marriages is split evenly between husbands and wives.
In all instances, it’s a big change from 50 years ago — when, for instance, husbands were the primary breadwinner in 85% of marriages.
Today, which women are most likely to be the primary or sole breadwinners can vary by age, family status, education and race.
For instance, Pew found Black women are “significantly more likely” than other women to earn more than their husbands. For instance, 26% of Black women bring home more than their husbands, while only 17% of White women and 13% of Hispanic women do.
But Black women with a college degree or higher and few children at home are also among the most likely to earn about the same as their husbands.
These numbers are reported against a backdrop of society’s attitudes about who should earn more and how caregiving should be divvied up between spouses.
Nearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew’s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them.
What do women want? Twenty-two percent of Americans said most women want a husband who earns more, while 26% said most would want a man who earns about the same.
Meanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. Only 19% said children are better off when their mother focuses more on home life and their father focuses more on his job.
The Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census’ Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/business/mcdonalds-burgers/index.html,McDonald’s is upgrading its burgers,,,,CNN,"McDonald’s, which has been focusing on upgrading its core items to boost sales, is rolling out a series of changes designed to improve its signature burgers .
Buns will be softer. Cheese, gooier. Onion will be added to patties right on the grill. And the Big Mac sauce? There will be more of it.
“We found that small changes, like tweaking our process to get hotter, meltier cheese and adjusting our grill settings for a better sear, added up to a big difference in making our burgers more flavorful than ever,” said chef Chad Schafer, senior director of culinary innovation of McDonald’s USA, in a statement Monday. The upgrades apply to the Big Mac and the McDouble burger as well as the classic cheeseburger, double cheeseburger and hamburger.
The improvements were first made to burgers in international markets, the company said, and have already arrived in some US cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas. They’ll be available nationally by early next year.
The changes follow other improvements to key menu items.
In 2018, McDonald’s announced that it was switching to fresh beef for its Quarter Pounders , a complicated move with a big sales payoff . In 2021, it launched a crispy chicken sandwich to replace previous iterations — a relatively late arrival in the chicken sandwich wars , but one that seems to have resonated with McDonald’s customers. .
“We are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,” thanks to improved burgers and items like the chicken sandwich, said McDonald’s (MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski during a January analyst call. “In an environment where our customers are looking for the simple and familiar, our core menu items have never been more relevant,” he said. In the US, sales at stores open at least 13 months jumped 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022, rising 10.3% for the whole year.
Focusing on promoting its core menu items, rather than introducing new products, is a way to keep processes simpler and reduce friction in the kitchen. And McDonald’s has been using promotions like celebrity meal platforms and the adult Happy Meal to create buzz around its signature items.
“Throughout 2022, some of our most successful campaign platforms brought our customers closer to the core menu items,” Kempczinski said during the January call.
McDonald’s isn’t the only brand trying to improve its main offerings.
Burger King, which last year announced a plan to turn its business around , has been focusing on improving the Whopper and making it more visible in advertising. In the fourth quarter last year, it held Whopper trainings for franchisees. The brand said in February that the Whopper contributed to higher US sales in that quarter."

Last month, Google employees learned that Samsung was weighing making Bing the default search engine on its devices instead of Google’s search engine, prompting a “panic” inside the company, according to a report from the New York Times, citing internal messages and documents. (CNN has not reviewed the material.)
In an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project “Magi,” according to the Times. The company, which reportedly has about 160 people working on the project, aims to change the way results appear in Google Search and will include an AI chat tool available to answer questions. The project is expected to be unveiled to the public next month, according to the report.
In a statement sent to CNN, Google spokesperson Lara Levin said the company has been using AI for years to “improve the quality of our results” and “offer entirely new ways to search,” including with a feature rolled out last year that lets users search by combining images and words.
“We’ve done so in a responsible and helpful way that maintains the high bar we set for delivering quality information,” Levin said. “Not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we’ve said before, we’re excited about bringing new AI-powered features to Search, and will share more details soon.”
Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Google’s search engine has dominated the market for two decades. But the viral success of ChatGPT, which can generate compelling written responses to user prompts, appeared to put Google on defense for the first time in years.
In March, Google began opening up access to Bard, its new AI chatbot tool that directly competes with ChatGPT and promises to help users outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge.
At an event in February, a Google executive also said the company will bring “the magic of generative AI” directly into its core search product and use artificial intelligence to pave the way for the “next frontier of our information products.”
Microsoft, meanwhile, has invested in and partnered with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to deploy similar technology in Bing and other productivity tools. Other tech companies, including Meta, Baidu and IBM, as well as a slew of startups, are racing to develop and deploy AI-powered tools.
But tech companies face risks in embracing this technology, which is known to make mistakes and “hallucinate” responses. That’s particularly true when it comes to search engines, a product that many use to find accurate and reliable information.
Google was called out after a demo of Bard provided an inaccurate response to a question about a telescope. Shares of Google’s parent company Alphabet fell 7.7% that day, wiping $100 billion off its market value.
Microsoft’s Bing AI demo was also called out for several errors , including an apparent failure to differentiate between the types of vacuums and even made up information about certain products.
In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stressed the need for companies to “be responsible in each step along the way” as they build and release AI tools.
For Google, he said, that means allowing time for “user feedback” and making sure the company “can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.”
He also expressed his belief that these AI tools will ultimately have broad impacts on businesses, professions and society.
“This is going to impact every product across every company and so that’s, that’s why I think it’s a very, very profound technology,” he said. “And so, we are just in early days.”"

The ruling earlier this month by a Texas federal judge to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug that is used frequently for medication abortions, is very personal for me.
That’s because I took mifepristone years ago during a miscarriage, and it saved my life.
When I was prescribed mifepristone, it had not yet taken center stage in America’s abortion wars. I did not have to make a rushed road trip across state lines to get my medicine, unlike many women who need the drug but live in one of the many states that have restricted access to medication abortion or passed near-total bans on abortion.
I was not forced to set up a secret meet-up with a stranger in order to buy my medicine on the black market, as several women I spoke to recently said they planned to do. Nor did I have to order mifepristone online and find myself navigating the many scammers taking advantage of the current patchwork of state abortion laws in the US.

Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion and the other, misoprostol, was not subject to the ruling by the Texas judge. The two drugs can be administered to someone having a miscarriage, allowing them to terminate the pregnancy when the fetus is not viable.
It happened some years ago: After experiencing more than a day of hemorrhaging during the first trimester of my pregnancy, I visited my ob-gyn, who explained after examining me that my blood pressure was dropping rapidly and the heavy bleeding I was experiencing was an unmistakable sign of a miscarriage.
For many women, being prescribed mifepristone is part of their routine medical care. Not so in my case: As my doctor explained, I was facing a dire medical emergency. I was grateful for the medication that saved my life.
My miscarriage took me by surprise. I had loved being pregnant the first time around, about a decade earlier. And as a healthy woman, I had no reason for fear when I became pregnant again. By the time I was administered mifepristone, I was losing a life that I had already begun to love. And like many other women, despite my level of education or economic status, I could not outrun the statistics that put Black women at higher risk.
Up to one in four known pregnancies will end in a miscarriage. And for Black women, the numbers are alarmingly higher. According to an analysis of 4.6 million pregnancies in seven countries, the risk of a miscarriage for Black women is 43% higher than for White women .

In the Black community, women have traditionally been taught to bear their burdens silently — keep your business to yourself — even after something as devastating as pregnancy loss. We are conditioned to do as I did back then, and keep it moving as we try to outrun the long list of statistics that tell us our lives are in danger from every direction, whether it be from health care risks to societal injustices or other stressors.
During my miscarriage, I was a woman who was afraid, hemorrhaging and in excruciating pain, in desperate need of safe, emergency medical care. Thanks to the administration of mifepristone, I was allowed dignity during my miscarriage. It’s what every woman deserves — whether it be facing a potentially life-threatening miscarriage or seeking an abortion.
I learned from my experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access to whatever medicines and counseling we need to help us heal and that includes mifepristone. What we don’t need is to be criminalized by politicians and punitive reproductive laws that have long been out of step with public opinion. Despite the continuing political attacks on women’s reproductive rights, more than 61% of US adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center .
After the US Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued a temporary order to preserve the status quo, ensuring access to the drug while giving the justices more time to study the issue.
I am hoping the justices can put politics aside and focus on the science surrounding the safety of mifepristone, a drug that, thankfully, I had access to when my life was in danger. Mifepristone, a synthetic steroid, is even safer than common prescription drugs including penicillin and Viagra.
Following the science demands that, regardless of where you stand on the issue of abortion, consideration must be made for cases like mine and the millions of other women who for years have safely used this medication for complications surrounding miscarriages.

We do not know how the legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across the nation – in blue and red states alike  – are watching. Punitive laws like the one signed last week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek to criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they are stripping us of rights that men take for granted – it’s unlikely they will be prohibited by the law from making health care decisions about their own bodies.
It must end. And I’m betting that whether it be with our voice or our votes, women will have the last word."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/opinions/2024-presidential-election-alternative-voters-lieberman,Opinion: A 2024 presidential alternative many voters will want,,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: Joe Lieberman, an independent, is a former US Senator who represented Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. He was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2000 presidential election. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
When Ralph Nader ran for president in 2000, he offered a simple rationale for a bid that would ultimately help “spoil” the election for the Democratic ticket I was privileged to be on with Al Gore. In Nader’s view, the two parties were ideologically indistinguishable.
That argument was baseless. There were significant differences in policy between the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket — which ended up victorious, in part thanks to Nader — and ours. For Nader, this wasn’t really about the “two-party duopoly,” as he coined it. This was about his desire to push Gore and the Democratic Party to the left.
Today, of course, no one can reasonably argue that the two parties aren’t ideologically distinct. The core problem in Washington, DC, is that they’re too divided to get much done.
Though a majority of Americans long for the era when Republicans and Democrats worked together to find bipartisan solutions to big problems, many members of Congress refuse to work together on immigration , the debt ceiling and other issues critical to the nation, even when bipartisanship is the way to restore our common prosperity and security. Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate, bipartisanship is the only way to pass any legislation.
While undoing the divisions plaguing our political system will not be simple, there is one step that can be taken — and it begins with giving voters a real alternative in the 2024 presidential election.
Most often, when Americans cast their votes for president and vice president, their ballot has only two viable tickets: one nominated by the Democratic Party and the other by the Republican Party. But what would happen if they had a third viable option?
The process for adding that third viable option is not only arduous and time-consuming, but it varies from state to state and in the District of Columbia.
Opinion: Don’t count DeSantis out yet; the GOP’s 2024 race is far from over
Today, No Labels , a nonprofit organization that I co-chair, is laying the groundwork for such a campaign in 2024. Since early 2022, our team has been diligently working across the country to obtain ballot access for a potential No Labels ticket, typically by collecting a certain number of petition signatures from voters in each state.
If we are successful, a unity ticket — comprised of one Democrat and one Republican — could be presented to voters right next to the Republican and Democratic nominees.
We think of this as an insurance policy for the country — an option to be deployed if, and only if, both of the two major party nominees fail to offer voters a choice of candidates they’d like to vote for or a way out of the partisan divisiveness that now dominates in the nation’s capital. We will be consistently monitoring the sentiment of Americans through our own research and polling, as well as public polling, to make that determination.
In this and several other ways, No Labels’ effort could not be more different from the “spoiler” campaign that Nader attempted two decades ago.
First, if No Labels were to lend its ballot lines to a presidential ticket, the presidential candidate would be a Democrat and the vice presidential candidate would be a Republican, or vice versa. As such, it would appeal to some voters who might otherwise have voted for the Democratic ticket, and other voters who might otherwise have voted for the Republican ticket. And it would appeal to still other voters who would not have voted for either.
Opinion: Why Biden is lying low ahead of 2024
These nominees would be selected by a diverse and distinguished group of citizens serving on a committee — and would be ratified by delegates who would gather at the No Labels National Convention planned for April 2024. This convention will occur about six weeks after the March 5th “Super Tuesday” primaries, a day which historically has clarified who the major party nominees will be.
Second, No Labels’ 2024 effort is not designed to push the Democratic nominees to the left or Republican candidates to the right. Rather, it’s intended to force one or both parties to appeal to America’s growing commonsense majority. If they don’t, our ballot line will create the opening for a unity ticket that will.
According to recent polling by CNN , the number of individuals who identify as independent is on the rise, now comprising 41% of the electorate — compared to only 28% who described themselves as Democrats and 31% who described themselves as Republicans. These numbers are more evidence that there could be a potential path to victory for an independent ticket in 2024.
But if there doesn’t appear to be such a path in the months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead on the work we have done over the last decade to elect and organize members of the House and Senate who have demonstrated the courage to reach across the aisle — including members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus.
It seems the Biden administration already may be beginning to recognize the imperative of appealing to the commonsense majority. President Joe Biden recently signed into law a Republican measure to strike down a Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties for those who commit violent crimes, and he announced more stringent border control policies.
Our hope is that the Republicans jockeying for their party’s nomination will similarly see the need to reach out beyond their base instead of appealing to divisive policies and politics.
In the end, No Labels hopes not to have to offer our ballot line to an independent unity ticket. We want the parties to come to their senses. But judging from the angry and apocalyptic reactions of strategists in both parties at the thought of No Labels’ insurance policy, it is clear that party leaders now know that there could be a political cost to ignoring the commonsense majority. And that’s a reason to hope for a better future for our government and our country."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/opinions/jim-jordan-clarence-thomas-judiciary-committee-obeidallah/index.html,Opinion: Why isn’t the House Judiciary Committee looking into red flags about Clarence Thomas?,,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him @DeanObeidallah@masto.ai . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
On Monday, the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee — chaired by Donald Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan — is set to hold a field hearing in New York City called “Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan.” A statement bills the hearing as an examination of how, the Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s policies have “led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.”
In response, Bragg’s office slammed Jordan’s hearing as “ a political stunt ” while noting that data released by the New York Police Department shows crime is down in Manhattan with respect to murders, burglaries, robberies and more through April 2, compared with the same period last year.
In reality, this Jordan-led hearing isn’t about stopping crime but about defending Trump — who was recently charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies . Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. The former president also is facing criminal probes in other jurisdictions over efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.
Bragg sued Jordan and his committee last week in federal court, accusing the Judiciary Committee chairman of a “ transparent campaign to intimidate and attack ” his office for its investigation and prosecution of Trump by making demands for confidential documents and testimony.
While Jordan and his committee appear focused on discrediting the investigation into Trump, why aren’t they looking into two recent bombshell reports by ProPublica that raised red flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After all, the House Judiciary Committee’s website explains that it has jurisdiction over “matters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts” – for which the revelations concerning Thomas fit perfectly.

First, we learned in early April that Crow had provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, for decades with luxurious vacations including on the donor’s yacht and private jet to faraway places such as Indonesia and New Zealand. That information was never revealed to the public. (In a rare public statement, Thomas responded he was advised at the time that he did not have to report the trips. The justice said the guidelines for reporting personal hospitality have changed recently . “And, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future,” he said.)
Then on Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas failed to disclose a 2014 real estate deal involving the sale of three properties he and his family owned in Savannah, Georgia, to that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One of Crow’s companies made the purchases for $133,363, according to ProPublica. A federal disclosure law passed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices and other officials to make public the details of most real estate sales over $1,000.
As ProPublica detailed, the federal disclosure form Thomas filed for that year included a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, but Thomas left that space blank. Four ethics law experts told ProPublica that Thomas’ failure to report it appears to be a violation of the law. (Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica on its report; CNN reached out to the Supreme Court and Thomas for comment.)

The House Judiciary Committee has long addressed issues such as those surrounding Thomas. In fact, the committee is where investigations and the impeachment of federal judges often commence.
One recent example came in 2010 with Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. , whom the committee investigated and recommended for impeachment.
The committee’s Task Force on Judicial Impeachment said evidence showed Porteous “intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings.” The Senate later found Porteous guilty of four articles of impeachment and removed him from the bench.
Yet the Judiciary Committee has neither released statements nor tweets raising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead, its Twitter feed is filled with repeated tweets whining that C-SPAN won’t cover Monday’s New York field hearing. Worse, the committee retweeted GOP Rep. Mary Miller’s tweet defending Thomas as being attacked “because he is a man of deep faith, who loves our country and believes in our Constitution.”
Jordan’s use of his committee to assist Trump should surprise no one. The House January 6 committee’s report called the Ohio Republican “ a significant player in President Trump’s efforts ” to overturn the election. The report detailed the lawmaker’s efforts to assist Trump including on “January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan led a conference call in which he, President Trump, and other Members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session.” As a result, the January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan to testify — but he refused to cooperate.
In contrast with the House panel, the Senate Judiciary Committee — headed by Democrats — announced in the wake of the reporting on Thomas that it plans to hold a hearing “on the need to restore confidence in the Supreme Court’s ethical standards.” Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia sent a letter Friday calling for a referral of Thomas to the US attorney general over “potential violations of the Ethics in Government Act 1978.”
The House Judiciary Committee’s website notes , “The Committee on the Judiciary has been called the lawyer for the House of Representatives.” Under Jordan that description needs to be updated to state that the Committee on the Judiciary is now “the lawyer for Donald J. Trump.” And the worst part is that the taxpayers are the ones paying for Jordan’s work on Trump’s behalf."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/opinions/top-secrets-come-spilling-out-opinion-column-galant/index.html,Opinion: Top secrets come spilling out,,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
In 1917, British analysts deciphered a coded message the German foreign minister sent to one of his country’s diplomats vowing to begin “unrestricted submarine warfare” and seeking to win over Mexico with a promise to “reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona” if the US entered the world war. When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.
“Never before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message,” wrote David Kahn in his classic 1967 history of secret communications, “The Codebreakers.” The Germans had taken great pains to keep their intentions confidential, and the codebreakers in London’s “Room 40” had to do a lot of work to decipher the telegram.
Their efforts stand in stark contrast to the ease with which secrets came tumbling out of a Pentagon intelligence network when 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard cyber specialist Jack Teixeira allegedly posted hundreds of documents on a Discord chatroom known as “Thug Shaker Central.” The disclosures likely won’t start a war, but they could prove extremely damaging to the US and several of its allies, including Ukraine.
Teixeira is one of more than one million people who have Top Secret clearance. “The Pentagon has already started taking steps to limit the number of people who have access to such sensitive information,” wrote Brett Bruen , a former US diplomat and Obama administration official. “But much more can be done. … Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government, have access to information that can shape the fate of nations and their leaders? ”
Writing in the Financial Times, Kori Schake saw “some good news.”
“While specific details will be incredibly valuable to Russia and other adversaries, these are not bombshell revelations: journalists had already reported Ukrainian ammunition running low; peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv were never likely; allies have long been aware that the US eavesdrops on them; and the disparaging assessment of Ukraine’s forthcoming offensive may prove no more accurate than previous predictions were.” These will not prove as damaging as the Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning disclosures.
But, she warned, “Technology making data ever more portable, distribution more global and communications more bespoke will make it easier to amass information and distribute it — either privately or publicly.”
In less than a week, the two Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House for their participation in a gun control protest were sent back to office by local officials.
Writing for CNN Opinion, Rep. Justin Pearson noted, “This should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessee’s legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case…”
“Over two-thirds of Americans — including four out of 10 Republicans — support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep. Jones, Rep. Johnson and I were protesting in favor of, in the wake of the senseless March 27 Covenant School massacre.”
“And yet, calls for common sense gun reform measures fall on deaf ears in our legislature where a Republican supermajority is wildly out of step with most people’s values.”
The politics of gun control have shifted, argued Democratic strategist Max Burns . The NRA’s internal struggles have weakened its influence while Democrats in office, who once feared touching the issue of guns, are increasingly speaking out. And they are making some progress in enacting new state laws, Burns noted.
“The American people decisively support Democratic proposals for addressing the scourge of gun violence. Political watchers who criticized Democrats for talking too much about abortion during the 2022 midterm elections later ate crow after that once-dreaded culture war topic topped the list of voter concerns nationally…
“Biden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to build yet another winning coalition out of an issue once viewed as political poison. ”
On Friday, the Supreme Court issued an order that temporarily ensured access to a key drug used in many medication abortions. The move gave the justices more time to consider the issue after a Texas federal judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion pill 23 years ago.
“If abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill — reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States — will be severely undercut,” wrote Michele Goodwin and Mary Ziegler .
“Beyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don’t like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are using junk science to bypass the will of the American public and restrict abortion …”
“There are no grounds for challenging mifepristone’s approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review — more than four years — before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe.”
In 1986, Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow bureau chief for US News & World Report, was seized by Soviet authorities and locked up in Lefortovo prison. He was the last American journalist to be arrested in Russia before last month’s detention of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich, who like Daniloff, speaks Russian fluently. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage but US officials have concluded that he was “wrongfully detained.”
As David A. Andelman noted, Daniloff’s detention in prison lasted for 13 days before he was put under house arrest and then eventually swapped for an accused Soviet spy. In a conversation with Andelman, Daniloff recalled his reaction when he was imprisoned. “I felt claustrophobic, and I felt like I wanted to get out of there immediately. Of course, there was no chance of that. The door slams, and you have all these thoughts and feelings that run through you, and then you settle down and you realize you’re going to be hanging around that cell for some time. ”
Gershkovich’s family in Philadelphia received a letter, handwritten in Russian, from the reporter Friday.
“I want to say that I am not losing hope ,” he noted. “I read. I exercise. And I am trying to write. Maybe, finally, I am going to write something good.”
The Amazon series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” returns this month for its fifth and final season — and David Perry is here for it. The series brings back memories of visiting his grandparents Irma and Mordy in their “tiny rent-controlled Greenwich Village apartment,” an experience that helped shape his Jewish identity.
“As a Jewish historian,” Perry wrote, “I worry about the tension between preserving the memory of past hardships while not locking our entire history into a tale of oppression. The moments of peace and joy are as vital as the moments of violence. In fact, it’s the periods of peace, of success, of interfaith community, that reveal the terrible truth about the violence: it wasn’t inevitable. People could have made different choices…”
“A show like ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ lets me revel in my personal New York Jewish heritage while also getting a little break from all the worry . It’s a warm, funny, sexy, extremely Jewish …. comedy that hits me straight in my glossy childhood memories. That isn’t to say the show isn’t also problematic — it most certainly is.”
In the latest installment of CNN Opinion’s “Little Kids, Big Questions” series, 10-year-old Ronan wonders if animals are capable of being smarter than humans. With the help of the John Templeton Foundation, which is partnering on the project, the answer came from Jane Goodall , world renowned for her work with chimpanzees.
“One of the attributes of intelligence is the ability to think and solve problems. In the early 1960s, I was told that this was unique to humans, and only we could use and make tools, only we had language and culture,” Goodall said. “But more and more research has proved that many animals are excellent at solving problems. Many use tools, and many show cultural differences. Some scientists believe that whales and dolphins are communicating with what may be a real language.”
“Although the difference between humans and other animals is simply one of degree, our intellect really is amazing. …bees can count and do math, and that just shows how much we still have to learn about animal intelligence. But humans can calculate the distance to the stars .”
Earlier this month, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder for fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020. The jury deliberated for 17 hours and decided Perry’s action couldn’t be excused under the state’s “stand your ground” law. Prosecutors argued Perry had instigated the incident and they introduced into evidence messages that suggested the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment act but a premeditated one.
On the evening of the jury verdict, Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticized the decision and told viewers he had invited Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the show to ask if he would consider pardoning Perry. Others on the right called for Abbott to issue a pardon, and the governor soon responded with an announcement that he would do just that, as long as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended that Perry should be granted one.
“Trial verdicts are determined by judges and juries,” wrote Dean Obeidallah . “ What Abbott is doing is not just wrong, it’s dangerous. His pardon, when it comes, is not what the rule of law looks like.”
Two of the likeliest candidates for president in 2024 haven’t officially committed yet.
President Joe Biden says he intends to run again but has delayed making a formal announcement. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is making all the moves a presidential contender usually makes, including hawking his new book and visiting New Hampshire, but he hasn’t joined fellow Republicans including former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson in declaring.
“DeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida should force GOP voters to think long and hard about what version of their party they want to put forward ,” observed Patrick T. Brown .
“A third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor.”
Even without an official announcement by the president, wrote Julian Zelizer , the Biden-Harris campaign is very much under way. “By choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as the ‘Rose Garden Strategy,’ whereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and showing voters that he is the responsible figure in the race.”
“The president’s understated strategy makes room for Republicans to stoke chaos, tear each other apart and make unforced errors while he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020: do voters want someone who will govern and act in a serious manner or do they want a circus? ”

It was a vivid reminder of what’s possible in air travel — and of what’s usually lacking.
Take the security system: “More than 20 years after Sept. 11, 2001, only passengers who pay for the privilege can avoid removing their shoes and laptops from their bags by submitting their personal information ahead of time and undergoing background checks.”
Filipovic added, “Admittedly, I do pay — I don’t want to wait in a long security line, walk my stocking feet through a metal detector and have to un- and re-pack the MacBook I’ve carefully crammed into my carry-on. But the existence of pay-to-play shorter-line security options like Clear and TSA Pre-Check make clear that it is indeed possible to pre-screen a critical mass of passengers to avoid the morass of cranky people trying to pull on their shoes while re-packing their electronics.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/opinions/sudan-revolution-to-civil-war-lynch/index.html,Opinion: How Sudan went from revolution to civil war,,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: Justin Lynch is a researcher and analyst in Washington, DC. He is co-author of the book “ Sudan’s Unfinished Democracy .” The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
Four years ago, almost to the day, the people of Sudan were celebrating a revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Now the East African country faces the possibility of a complete collapse similar to the chaos we see today in Yemen or Libya.
On Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other in the capital of Khartoum. The two sides battled for control of the nation’s airports, bases and military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into the streets and across the country.
Some 45 million Sudanese effectively are held hostage and are unable to venture out of their homes for fear of being killed in the crossfire. At least 180 people have perished in the fighting, including three World Food Programme humanitarian workers.
The conflict pits two bitter rivals and their powerful armed forces against each other. On one side are the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. On the other side are the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.
There is no good side in this conflict. Both have been accused of a long litany of human rights violations.
How did Sudan go from casting off despotic rule and creating a fledgling democracy a few years ago to teetering on the brink of state collapse?
On April 11, 2019, Sudan’s longtime dictator, Bashir, was overthrown . The cause of Bashir’s removal was months of protests led by Sudan’s unions, which spurred a military coup from the SAF and RSF. Both Burhan and Hemeti joined forces to remove their former boss.

It was a moment of promise because there was hope for democracy. I remember walking around the “sit-in” — a giant carnival of freedom in the middle of Khartoum that protesters had blocked off to demand change. It was electric.
But social movements such as the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) — the union behind the protest — often struggle to translate the momentum of their demonstrations into real political power.
The reason for this is, in part, structural. Social movements such as the SPA are often based on grassroots activism. A dictator can arrest one or two leaders of an organization but not an entire country.
However, once a dictator is overthrown, these kinds of social movements often struggle to build the leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudan’s protesters were unable to translate mobilization into political power.

Civilian leaders entered into a negotiation with the military over the future of the country shortly after Bashir fell in April 2019. The two sides were not evenly matched. Because of these leadership challenges, the pro-democracy forces struggled to bargain with the disciplined military.
Any momentum that pro-democracy advocates had during the negotiations was stamped out in June 2019 when RSF soldiers violently dispersed the sit-in. More than 100 people were killed.
After the June massacre and the leadership challenges, a transitional constitution was signed in August 2019 that gave the SAF and RSF most of the power in Sudan. Burhan was the head of state, and Hemeti was placed in an elevated political position. Elections were promised in 2022, but few believed they would actually happen.
The transitional period began in August 2019, and I interviewed Abdalla Hamdok , the civilian prime minister, several times for a book that I co-wrote on Sudan’s revolution. The way that the constitution was written meant that Hamdok had limited power as the prime minister. Burhan was the head of state and wanted to preserve the powers of the SAF.
Hamdok often told me that revolutions come in cycles. The 2019 removal of Bashir was a high point of revolution, and he saw his job as making as many reforms as possible before the low tide of counterrevolution swept him away.
Hamdok found that the legacy of 30 years of dictatorship meant that Sudan’s political and economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan and Hemeti blocked the big reforms that Hamdok wanted to make.

Outside Khartoum violence grew. Parts of Sudan such as Darfur saw a new round of conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated by RSF troops. More than 430,000 people were displaced due to conflict in Sudan, mostly in Darfur.
Soldiers did not hide the atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking tea with a soldier aligned with the RSF at his house in Darfur as he explained why he had recently participated in the burning down of a village from another ethnic group.
The soldier reasoned that a member of his tribe had been killed in an altercation, so the RSF-aligned forces took revenge by torching a village that had been home to 30,000 people . At least 163 people died .
Tensions between the SAF and RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti and his RSF forces as upstart usurpers from Darfur who were undisciplined. Hemeti on the other hand believed that it was time for Darfur to lead Sudan.
Hamdok was on the cusp of beginning to turn the economy around when Burhan and the SAF intervened. As we wrote in the book “Sudan’s Unfinished Democracy,” the potential success of a civilian government was too much for Burhan. In October 2021, Hamdok was removed in a military coup.
After the October 2021 coup, the United States and United Nations pushed a worse version of the transitional constitution in Sudan. They argued that it was the best way to bring democracy.
The idea was to restart the transitional period, but I and many others argued it was shortsighted and wouldn’t work . Returning to a government led by Burhan was clearly not going to usher in democracy. If the plan ended in a coup the first time, why would it work the second time?
Related article How the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russia's 'meat-grinder'
Some activists stopped partnering with the US and came to see the UN mission as a roadblock to democracy because of these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with the best American and foreign diplomats, who also understood the international policy in Sudan wouldn’t work. They saw the flaws but felt powerless to dissent and were forced to carry out decisions made many levels above them.
What preceded this weekend’s outbreak of clashes was a controversial part of the international policy that tried to unify the SAF and RSF. The idea was to make a single army, but neither Hemeti nor Burhan wanted to give up the power they had amassed.
The plan to unify the military hadn’t worked in similar contexts. It was a repeat of the 2013 and 2016 unification processes that took place in South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead, the tenuous relationship between Burhan and Hemeti boiled over due to the pressure.
It can be easy to look at the recent history of “revolutions” in countries such as Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan and conclude that they eventually backfire. I don’t agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that a nation’s political fortune is an active battle.
We can one day hope that Sudan sees dreams of democracy come true. But right now, the Sudanese people are just hoping to survive the day.
The lesson from Sudan is that a revolution is only the start of change, not the end."

After winning a best actress Oscar for her role in “Everything Everywhere All At Once” last month, Yeoh is preparing to step back into the Star Trek universe to reprise her role as Emperor Philippa Georgiou in the new “Star Trek: Section 31” movie.
Yeoh was first introduced as the character in 2017, when the Emmy-winning “Star Trek: Discovery” TV series debuted on Paramount+.
Paramount+ and CBS Studios announced the news on Tuesday. Yeoh will also serve as an executive producer on the project.
Yeoh said in a press release that she is “beyond thrilled” to reprise her role in the “Section 31” movie, which she says “has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of ‘Star Trek’ launched.”
“To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that’s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can’t wait to share what’s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise),” she continued.
It truly has been a year of dreams coming true for Yeoh, who made history as the first woman of Asian descent to win an Oscar in the best actress category in March. “Everything Everywhere All At Once” took home seven Oscars that night, including Yeoh’s big win and the top prize for best picture.
“Section 31” will showcase Yeoh’s character as she joins a secret division of Starfleet and is “tasked with protecting the United Federation of Planets and faces the sins of her past,” according to an official synopsis.
“Star Trek: Section 31” will begin production later this year."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/entertainment/succession-season-4-episode-4-recap/index.html,‘Succession’ Season 4 Episode 4 recap: ‘The Aftermath’ finds the dark humor in Logan’s exit (SPOILERS),,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: The following contains major spoilers about the fourth episode of “Succession’s” fourth season, “Honeymoon States.”
After the shock came the aftershocks, the power vacuum, and perhaps most significantly and impressively, the laughs, as “Succession” pivoted to face life after Logan Roy, in an episode that finally put the HBO show’s title into full flower.
Logan Roy’s abrupt demise left his grown children and subordinates scrambling, with each seemingly humbly offering themselves up to fill the void, while fretting about how the various candidates would play with the company’s board.
At the same time, they mourned the larger-than-life figure they had lost, taking into account that he had treated many of them abysmally. And the fourth hour also marked the return of Logan’s wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), in what felt like “Marcia Strikes Back,” while his current and much younger girlfriend, Kerri (Zoe Winter), was bluntly shown the door. (The latter evoked memories of the musical “Evita,” when the title character boots Peron’s mistress, who sings about another suitcase in another hall.)
More than anything, the episode underscored just how brutally funny “Succession” can be, with Shiv (Sarah Snook) reading her father’s obituary and musing, “Dad sounds amazing. I would like to have met dad,” while brothers Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) hilariously translated the language, with references to Logan having been “a man of his time” equaling “racist.”
The episode also showcased the executives at Waystar Royco, who uncomfortably wondered what to do with a document that included not only Logan’s posthumous wishes but hand-written notes that seemingly specified who he wished to succeed him. They joked, feebly, about tossing the paper in the toilet, while making very clear how much they really wanted to toss the paper in the toilet.
All the knives came out, with Carl (David Rasche) brutally insulting Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), scarcely hiding behind the fact that he was presenting the doubts about Tom’s future as a hypothetical.
Amid that, though, there were also human moments, with the tortured Kendall articulating his conflicted feelings to Waystar executive Frank (Peter Friedman) by saying, “He made me hate him, and he died. I feel like he didn’t like me. I disappointed him.”
“Succession” also underscored the fragility of not just life, but a corporate legacy, with the public-relations folk discussing how to spin and diminish Logan’s involvement in his later years as a means of bucking up the company and its stock price – a maneuver that Kendall ultimately and surreptitiously approved, concluding that it was the sort of smart and ruthless move that his father would have executed.
Questions of succession also appear to be threatening the harmony achieved by Kendall, Shiv and Roman prior to Logan’s exit, with Shiv being left as the odd woman out in a plan to fill the CEO seat just long enough to close the sale to GoJo. Trust doesn’t come easily in series creator Jesse Armstrong’s world, and when Shiv said, “I need to wet my beak,” the assurances from her brothers clearly left the impression how easily that beak could wind up bent out of joint.
Ultimately, after the operating highs of the previous episode, the series successfully turned the page from grieving to the next order of business. And that too, as Kendall put it regarding Logan and the “bad dad” PR leaks, is “what he would do.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/yellowjackets-90s-music/index.html,"‘Yellowjackets’ leans hard into ’90s music nostalgia, and we’re here for it",,,,CNN,"Of the many dark gifts Showtime’s eerie hit series “ Yellowjackets ” serves up for us, the juiciest this season is by far the music.
The show – which bounces between a troupe of teen soccer players trapped in the 1990s Canadian wilderness after a plane crash and the survivors’ corresponding adult selves in the present day – embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from the tail end of last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt and much more.
In Sunday’s episode of “Yellowjackets,” alt-rock queen Alanis Morissette will debut a version of the show’s theme song, “No Return,” and has already released it as a single.
One of the most unexpected and successful uses of throwback music came in the first episode of Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole’s Jeff had a moment to himself in the car after an intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) – during which he rocks out hard to Papa Roach’s “Last Resort” (sure, the track actually came out in 2000, but that doesn’t take away from its retro vibe).
In an interview with CNN, the show’s music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that the Papa Roach song selection was scripted, and “served as a perfect physical outlet for Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone in his garage.”
Other standout moments in the script, however, are hers to interpret, and Felder relishes the opportunity to match those moments with the right songs from the period.
“I re-immerse myself into the show’s era and spirit of the times as I start to build my playlists for the show,” she said. “The main thing I try to keep in mind is to just stay true to the story and let it tell me what it might need musically.”
Case in point, from the same episode – the placement of Amos’s signature track “Cornflake Girl,” off her groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album “Under the Pink.”
The song – which appropriately has the lyric “Things are getting kind of gross” just as teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) is about to ingest something unthinkable – “came to mind pretty quickly as a possibility” to Felder.
“I felt that Amos’s lyrics could serve as a befitting launchpad for the first episode’s ending – not only as a reflection of Young Shauna’s state of mind,” she noted, “but also as a reflection of the past and present moods and mentalities lived out by the other ‘Yellowjackets’ characters in Season 2.”
Felder’s work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something technical or because the needs of the scene evolve during production, as a result of many elements, including the actors’ performances.
“Everyone on the team always wants the best song-select possible to enhance the story,” she said. “When we get to post (production), the common question that comes up among us during the collaboration process is simply, ‘Do we think we can beat this?’”
During that collaborative process, Felder says she doesn’t “believe there is an exact roadmap into how to merge songs with any given scene or story.”
“I always say, ‘Let the picture tell you what it needs.’ (Kind of like the Wilderness I guess?)”
Another moment that feels perfectly melded to the music playing is the now-infamous ‘last supper’ scene from last week’s second episode, which boasts Radiohead’s “Climbing By The Walls” from their mindblowing 1995 album “OK Computer” on the soundtrack.
“The song seems to refer to those unspeakable monsters that can live in one’s head,” Felder noted, referencing the strange collective hallucinations the group undergoes while cannibalizing one of their own. “I can’t think of a more perfect way to hauntingly accent (that) scene, a.k.a. ‘the feast.’”
To drive home just how important music is to the specific ambient feel of “Yellowjackets,” one need look no further than the super creepy Season 2 trailer for the show, which features Florence + The Machine’s exceptional and haunting rendition of No Doubt’s timeless 1995 hit, “ Just A Girl. ”
“I’m such a huge fan of ‘Yellowjackets’ and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a ‘deeply unsettling’ way for show,” band frontwoman Florence Welch said in a statement shared with CNN.
“We tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone who’s first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani, it was a dream job.”
Of her collaboration with “Yellowjackets,” Morrisette, too, felt inspired by the show.
“I see parallels between ‘Yellowjackets’ and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane,” Morissette said in a statement. “I’ve strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and what’s so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women. I feel honoured to be a part of the legacy of ‘Yellowjackets.’”"

The “ Rennervations ” star posted to the Stories portion of his verified Instagram account ahead of the weekend, showing his recent visit to Renown Regional Medical Center, a Reno, Nevada hospital.
“I got to revisit the amazing group of people who saved my life,” Renner, 52, wrote over a photo of himself posing in the center of a group of people standing in front of a screen that displayed the words “Welcome back!”
He included two other photos with staffers from the medical center, including one outside in front of a Renown sign.
Renner was crushed by a snowplow on New Year’s Day near his Nevada home while trying to clear snow for a relative, and broke several bones including eight ribs, an eye socket, a knee and shoulder. His liver was also pierced, and one of his lungs collapsed.
Last week, the “Hawkeye” star made his first red carpet appearance since the life-threatening incident, for the premiere of his Disney+ series “ Rennervations .”
In the show, he and his team help refurbish and repurpose service vehicles to help communities and children in need.
Three episodes are currently streaming, with a fourth, set in India, to premiere soon."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/barry-season-4-review/index.html,‘Barry’ season 4 review: Bill Hader keeps taking wild chances as the show takes a whack at its farewell season,,,,CNN,"“Barry” has taken chances from the very beginning, which is certainly true of a fourth and final season that picks up where the third left off , with its hitman-turned-wannabe actor getting arrested. That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates the show’s ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines with flights of fancy.
Thanks to “Succession,” “Barry” won’t be the highest-profile goodbye on HBO this spring, but the Emmy-nominated series isn’t chopped liver either. It’s fair to say, in fact, that while these episodes don’t quite measure up to what’s gone before, even a less-lethal “Barry” is still very, very good.
Bill Hader’s auteur turn as director-producer-star remains one of TV’s most unpredictable series, and the new season has a strong “Better Call Saul” vibe to it, triggered by fallout from the seemingly inevitable fact that Hader’s Barry couldn’t maintain his double life forever.
The consequences of his arrest flare out to both sides of that equation, from his acting teacher Gene Cousineau (as played by Henry Winkler , still a towering mixture of ego and need) and girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg) to the rogues gallery of petty criminals in his orbit, including Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who has improbably found love in the course of his travels, while somehow turning “Barry” into a four-syllable name.
“Barry” has always wrestled with the discomfort of having a protagonist who murders people, and the question of empathizing with its namesake becomes particularly acute in these episodes with the character in prison. When Barry asks, “Are you mad at me?” with an almost-childlike naivete, it’s easy to forget, at least momentarily, some of the horrible things he’s done, even if the revenge-minded Jim Moss (Robert Wisdom) can’t.
Hader (who directed every episode) also excels at darkly comic visual gags, which are augmented in the new season with a few hysterical cameos by actual Hollywood figures, among them director Guillermo del Toro, made even funnier by how random they seem to be.
That said, the show’s surreal digressions and detours into fantasy become more distracting, in a way that feels a little too precious at times. The saving grace, consistently, is the strength of the cast, even if prison creates impediments to their interactions.
HBO made most but not all of the season available, and the series effectively keeps the audience on edge and guessing about where it will all end up, and how (or if) its various threads will connect.
The likelihood of a happy ending for everyone in “Barry”-land never seemed to be in the cards, but Hader and co-creator Alec Berg appear determined to exit on their own terms, as good (mostly) and sporadically frustrating as that might be. That’s why it’s hard to get mad at a show that takes such bracing creative risks, even with a season that isn’t quite the stone-cold killer that it has been.
“Barry” begins its fourth and final season April 14 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html,Chinese spy balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing,,,,CNN,"The Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.
The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.
Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.
A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”
The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said .
As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.
The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.
CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.
The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.
A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”
Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”
The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.
Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.
China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported .
Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,Beijing promised to ‘fight back’ over Taiwan leader Tsai’s US visit. But this time it has more to lose,,,,CNN,"An anticipated meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.
At that time, Beijing encircled the island democracy with unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.
It also cut off contact with the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.
This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.
It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to “serious” confrontation between the two powers.
A defiant Tsai staked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.
But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations and ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.
“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.
That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.
The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.
“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.
The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office announced earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.
Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed suspected Chinese surveillance balloon to semiconductor supply chains – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.
Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.
But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.
For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.
That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.
China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.
Related article China thinks it's diplomatically isolating Taiwan. It isn't
The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.
That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”
It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.
Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.
While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.
Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.
Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.
Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.
A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.
Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric in mainland China.
This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.
But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.
As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.
It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member Ma Ying-jeou , the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.
Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.

China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter global spotlight following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.
Beijing has recently sought to position itself as an agent of peace in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.
This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.
An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a face-to-face meeting in Bali.
“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.
“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/world/artemis-2-astronaut-crew-scn/index.html,Artemis II: The 4 astronauts NASA picked for moon mission,,,,CNN,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more .
Astronauts who will helm the first crewed moon mission in five decades were revealed on Monday, queuing up the quartet to begin training for the historic Artemis II lunar flyby that is set to take off in November 2024.
The astronauts are NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency.
Wiseman is a 47-year-old decorated naval aviator and test pilot who was first selected to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.
Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.
Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.
He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.
Glover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.
“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”
Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.
Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.
Koch , 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019 . She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.
The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.
If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.
The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.
After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.
Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.
The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.
NASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later .
The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.
Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process . But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.
“I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on inaugural missions .
Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.
“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”
She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”
“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”
An interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.

Schiappa, who has been a government minister since 2017, appeared on the cover of the magazine to accompany a 12-page interview she did on women’s and LGBT rights. Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.
Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.
Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.
Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.
France is currently in the throes of a political and social crisis triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron ’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.
“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.

French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.
“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.
Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”
French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”
“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/investing/british-pound-currency-dollar/index.html,Britain’s pound is beating every other major currency this year,,,,CNN,"The British pound crashed to a record low last fall as investors rebelled against budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.
Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.
The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.
This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.
Inflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February , underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.
The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.
The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.
“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.
But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.
“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.
The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.
Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.
A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.
Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.
“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/sanna-marin-finland-elections-concedes-intl/index.html,Sanna Marin: Finland’s Prime Minister concedes election,,,,CNN,"Finland’s left-wing Prime Minister Sanna Marin conceded defeat on Sunday in the Nordic country’s parliamentary election as the opposition right-wing National Coalition Party (NCP) claimed victory in a tightly fought contest.
The pro-business NCP was expected to win 48 of the 200 seats in parliament, narrowly ahead of the nationalist Finns Party with 46 seats and Marin’s Social Democrats on 43 seats, justice ministry election data showed with all ballots counted.
“We got the biggest mandate,” NCP leader Petteri Orpo said in a speech to followers, vowing to “fix Finland” and its economy.
He will get the first chance at forming a coalition to obtain majority in parliament as Marin’s era as prime minister was expected to end.

“We have gained support, we have gained more seats (in parliament). That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.
Marin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for her partying and her government’s public spending.

While she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.
The NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.
Orpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.
Orpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.
Marin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.
The Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.
Most notable of Marin’s foreign policy actions has been her push, along with President Sauli Niinisto, for the country to make a watershed policy U-turn by seeking NATO membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine .
That process is now almost complete, with Helsinki expected to join within days after all the Western defense alliance’s 30 members approved the accession."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/nasal-vaccine-sterilizing-immunity/index.html,A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise,,,,CNN,"Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body.
In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.
Related article WHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk
Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.
China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working.  Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.
The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.
As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself.  And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.
Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.
Related article China approves its first mRNA Covid-19 vaccine
One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.
It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.
The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.
“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.
Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do.  They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have.  Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.
The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies.  Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.
The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.
“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.
In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology , two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.
The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.
The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.
As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted.  This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.

“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.
The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus.  In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished.  Researchers think it will need an update.
It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that.  The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.
Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said.  Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.
In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that.  All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.
“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.
At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according t o the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.
The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.
Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.

One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.
Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus.  It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix.  Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.
The German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.
“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.
They have reason to worry.  Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.
FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.
Another consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone.  People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.
“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/israel-protests-military-veterans-intl-cmd/index.html,"Israeli military veterans, a backbone of protest movement, vow to keep demonstrating",,,,CNN,"In a sea of Israeli flags, Yiftach Golov holds one that looks a little different.
Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.”
They are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy.
“We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies.
During the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University.
But when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission.
Some, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary.
Others have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.
While Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation.
“We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.

Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.
They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.
“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”
Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.
Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.
But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.
Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.”
In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security.
Under pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.”
“Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added.
But Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.
Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.
“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/kurdish-kingmaker-turkish-elections-mime-intl/index.html,Erdogan’s political fate may be determined by Turkey’s Kurds,,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here .
Turkey’s persecuted pro-Kurdish party has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.
“We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a statement on March 23 . “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.”
It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader Selahattin Demirtas has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics.
The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu , Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media.
Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.

“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”
Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, an ethnic minority from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.
The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.
But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.
Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.
It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.
The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.
If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.
The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.
“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.
Related article Erdogan's political fate may rest on his response to the earthquake
The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.
“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”
The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”
Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.
Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.
The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.
A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”
Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.
“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.

China and Brazil have reached an agreement to ditch USD and use their own currencies—China Daily pic.twitter.com/q33U4kVO5Q
An Iranian state news outlet is gloating at what it sees as the demise of the US dollar.
IRNA recreated a popular meme to mark China and Brazil’s decision to reportedly ditch the US dollar as an intermediary in trade, citing the Chinese state news outlet, China Daily. It shows two men representing China and Brazil posing in front of a grave labelled “USD.”
The meme was pinned to the top of IRNA’s Twitter page , and was met with laughter and ridicule. “Dream on,” said another user, pointing to the dollar’s use as the main reserve currency around the world.
China Daily said that the agreement was part of “the rising global use of the Chinese renminbi.” It would reportedly enable China and Brazil to conduct trade and financial transactions using local currencies instead of the dollar."

Musk addressed the change Monday afternoon, tweeting , “as promised” above an image of a year-old conversation in which another user suggested that Musk “just buy Twitter” and “change the bird logo to a doge.”

The doge logo appeared on the site two days after Musk asked a judge to throw out a $258 billion racketeering lawsuit accusing him of running a pyramid scheme to support the dogecoin, according to Reuters.
Lawyers for Musk and Tesla called the lawsuit by dogecoin investors a “fanciful work of fiction” over Musk’s “innocuous and often silly tweets.”
It wasn’t clear whether the logo change was permanent. Musk has been known to use Twitter to troll both his fans and his critics.
The price of dogecoin, which is typically volatile, was up more than 20% over the past 24 hours, to about 9 cents. It was trading just under 8 cents Monday morning.
Dogecoin was created December 6, 2013, by a pair of software engineers — as a joke. The name is a nod to the “doge” meme that became popular a decade ago. Its Shiba Inu mascot mimicks that meme: a dog surrounded by a bunch of Comic Sans text in broken English."

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) will review products sold by Micron in the country, according to a statement by the watchdog late on Friday.
The move is aimed at “ensuring the security of key information infrastructure supply chains, preventing cybersecurity risks caused by hidden product problems, and maintaining national security,” it noted.
It came on the same day that Japan, a US ally, said it would restrict the export of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to countries including China, following similar moves by the United States and the Netherlands.
Washington and its allies have announced curbs on China’s semiconductor industry, which strike at the heart of Beijing’s bid to become a tech superpower.
Last month, the Netherlands also unveiled new restrictions on overseas sales of semiconductor technology, citing the need to protect national security. In October, the United States banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license.
Micron told CNN it was aware of the review.
“We are in communication with the CAC and are cooperating fully,” it said, adding that it stands by the security of its products. “Micron’s product shipments, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other functions are operating as normal.”
Shares in Micron sank 4.4% on Wall Street Friday following the news, the biggest drop in more than three months. On Monday, they closed another 1.2% lower. Micron derives more than 10% of its revenue from China.
In an earlier filing , the Idaho-based company had warned of such risks.
“The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies,” it said last week.

China has strongly criticized restrictions on tech exports, saying last month it “firmly opposes” such measures.
In efforts to boost growth and job creation, Beijing is seeking to woo foreign investments as it grapples with mounting economic challenges. The newly minted premier Li Qiang and several top economic officials have been rolling out the welcome wagon for global CEOs and promising they would “provide a good environment and services.”
But Beijing has also exerted growing pressure on foreign companies to bring them into line with its agenda.
Last month, authorities closed the Beijing office of Mintz Group, a US corporate intelligence firm, and detained five local staff.
Days earlier, they suspended Deloitte’s operations in Beijing for three months and imposed a fine of $31 million over alleged lapses in its work auditing a state-owned distressed debt manager.

Bao Fan, 52, started the boutique investment bank in 2005 and has been unreachable since the middle of February, according to the company. Shares in China Renaissance have plunged since Bao went missing, at one point dropping as much as 50%.
China Renaissance said in late February that it had learned Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” being carried out by certain authorities in the country. It gave no other details.
Chinese media have reported Bao might be assisting in an investigation related to a former executive at China Renaissance.
In a filing on Sunday, China Renaissance said auditors couldn’t complete their work or sign off on their report because of Bao’s absence. The board was also unable to give an estimate about when it would be able to approve its audited results for 2022 or dispatch its annual report by an April 30 deadline as required by Hong Kong’s listing rules.

Trading in the company’s shares was suspended from Monday as a result.
Bao is known as a veteran dealmaker who works closely with top technology companies in China. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping. Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.
His team has also invested in US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio (NIO) and Li Auto and helped Chinese internet giants Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD) complete their secondary listings in Hong Kong.
Over the weekend, China’s top anti-graft watchdog launched an investigation into Liu Liange, former party secretary and chairman of Bank of China, according to a statement by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission. The bank is state-owned and one of the country’s four biggest lenders.
Liu is suspected of “serious violations of discipline and law,” the statement said. He is among the most senior financial executives targeted in a broader financial crackdown by President Xi Jinping.
In January, Wang Bin, former party chief and chairman of China Life Insurance, was charged by national-level prosecutors with taking bribes and hiding overseas savings.

At an informal shareholder meeting in Hong Kong, Chairman Mark Tucker and CEO Noel Quinn took questions from investors on issues ranging from how the bank was approaching demands for an overhaul of its business to its purchase of Silicon Valley Bank’s UK arm .
In prepared remarks, Tucker and Quinn each reiterated the board’s recommendation that shareholders vote against a resolution on the docket for its annual general meeting in May that would force the bank to come up with a plan to spin off or reorganize its Asian business — the lender’s main source of profits.

Tucker said the board was unanimous in its opposition to the resolution, stating plainly: “It would not be in your interest to split the bank.”
He said the board had previously reviewed a range of options for restructuring the bank, and concluded that such alternatives would “materially destroy value for shareholders,” including dividends.
“Our strategy is working,” Tucker told the room of more than 1,000 shareholders. “Our current strategy is moving dividends up.”
HSBC has been facing calls to separate its Asian business from the rest of the bank over the past year.
Shareholders in Hong Kong — where HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors’ portfolios — contend that the London-based lender’s performance has been dragged down by its businesses in other regions.
Quinn addressed those complaints head-on Monday, saying “our profits in Hong Kong and the UK are no longer being dragged down by underperformance elsewhere. The group is performing well as a whole.”
Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss”  because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.
Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC scrapping its dividend in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.
Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.
“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.
“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”
Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender bringing back its dividend in 2021, albeit at a lower level.
Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.
The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.
Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”
His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.
HSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.
Ping An (PNGAY) , China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.
In a series of remarks made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.”
Since then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe.
The insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.
HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had scooped up the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.
Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.
“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.

Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence.
Tucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC.
“After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted.
But he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added."

Americans have grown used to corporate executives treading the well-worn paths of the Northeast corridor to convene alongside elected officials in Washington, DC, and discuss geopolitics, policy and all that’s in-between.
In 2017, major CEOs from across the country came together to oppose North Carolina’s transgender bathroom law. In 2019, they called abortion bans “bad for business.”
After the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters and pledged to halt their political giving.
Recently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarily curtail their operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine.
Dick’s Sporting Goods stopped selling semi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup put new restrictions on gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.
A year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio, Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales .
Corporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this past summer nearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation to address it .
That’s why corporate America’s silence in the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.
But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said.
Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.
This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld: Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism?
The CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.
So is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating?
I just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.
The nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?
So what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf?
They’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.
It sounds like CEOs are frustrated?
Yeah, they’re frustrated.
But don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians?
You would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the  Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.
By CNN’s Chris Isidore
Tesla reported. a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.
The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.
Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.
But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.
“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”"

His research interprets osteological and material culture remains alongside historic texts to examine changing human-animal relationships in Europe and North America over the past 500 years. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.
Why do we bury our departed loved ones in a cemetery? A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.
But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?
The Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the country’s first public pet cemetery. Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.
For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where 50% of families own a pet.
How did a city that is home to 180,000 dogs not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, according to Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”
After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas since the late 19th century. Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.
I became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.
This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.
This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?
This, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.
Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.
The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.
Like the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.
My study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.
By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”

Society’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”
I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.
Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the co-burial of cremated animals and people , which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.
For me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.
The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.
The RSPCA reassures the public on its website that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the Blue Cross and Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center offer counseling to bereaved humans.
Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.
At an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.
This will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and digital pet cemeteries also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.
Whether one chooses a pet cemetery or not, there are many acceptable ways to express your grief – and to remember your relationship with the important animals in your life."

Cruising at a depth of 8,336 meters (over 27,000 feet) just above the seabed, a young snailfish has become the deepest fish ever filmed by scientists during a probe into the abyss of the northern Pacific Ocean.
Scientists from University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology released footage of the snailfish on Sunday filmed last September by sea robots in deep trenches off Japan.
Along with the filming the deepest snailfish, the scientists physically caught two other specimens at 8,022 meters and set another record for the deepest catch.
Previously, the deepest snailfish ever spotted was at 7,703 meters in 2008, while scientists had never been able to collect fish from anywhere below 8,000 meters.
“What is significant is that it shows how far a particular type of fish will descend in the ocean,” said marine biologist Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, who led the expedition.
Scientists are filming in the trenches off Japan as part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world. Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.
During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.
In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.
Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.
Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.
Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as Pseudoliparis belyaevi – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.
They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.
The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.
Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.
“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/energy/gas-prices-opec/index.html,What OPEC’s surprise oil cut means for US gas prices,,,,CNN,"OPEC and its allies’ surprise move to slash oil production will soon be felt at US gas pumps.
The group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would cut oil production by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday.
The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.
“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”
The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.
“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.
The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a record $5.02 a gallon on June 14 , before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the average price fell every day . The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve , and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline.
Related article Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts
Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.
“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said."

Last year, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused Republican leaders to denounce her .
Last week, Greene’s Twitter account was temporarily suspended by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with a graphic referring to a “Trans Day of Vengeance,” as she denounced a planned transgender rights rally .
And come Tuesday, Greene has announced plans to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on an indictment of more than 30 counts , calling the proceedings against him an “ unconstitutional WITCH HUNT! ”
But on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter with the tease : “Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn’t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.” The images attached to this tweet by “60 Minutes” include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone.
Related article It's time for Marjorie Taylor Greene to go
In the segment that aired Sunday night, Stahl noted the congresswoman had moved from the fringe to the GOP’s front row in two years despite a “sharp tongue” and “some pretty radical views” as well as “over the top” comments such as “the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.” Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.)
But Stahl didn’t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters.
Criticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been swift and well-deserved even before the program aired. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted beforehand : “Wow. Insane that 60 min would do this.” (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.)
Journalist Molly Jong-Fast also slammed “60 Minutes” with the tweet: “Attention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.” (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to Greene’s past claim that a massive California wildfire was started by “a laser” beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.)
David Hogg , who survived the 2018 horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become an activist against gun violence, responded , “I look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she’s supported QAnon.”
Related article Trump's risky call for protests
Greene amplified the conspiracy theory — two years before being elected to Congress — that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, Greene appeared on video confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on social media .
Greene’s own tweet promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.”
Now, it is true that “60 Minutes” over its 50-plus-year history has featured what the show has dubbed “ controversial ” guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , whose 1995 terrorist attack left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Perhaps “60 Minutes” views Greene — who has repeatedly downplayed and even defended the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of “ Christian nationalism ” — in the vein of its long list of controversial guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)
However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the comments of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” Moonves added , “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”
Moonves may be gone from CBS, but it appears his mindset continues at “60 Minutes.” And that may be good for “60 Minutes,” but it’s definitely not good for America."

Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.
The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.
Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.
The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.
Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.
At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home by late 2015 – about half of Syria’s pre-war population.
Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.
While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.
Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.

The move sparked a backlash in Germany and the sudden growth of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the wake of summer 2015.
Once in Germany, Alshebl lived close to Ostelsheim and said at the time he felt “there is only one thing you can do: get back on your feet quickly and start investing in your own future quickly.”
For the last seven years he worked in the administration of Althengstett town hall, in a neighboring town. He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda.
Alshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/autism-lithium-study/index.html,"Autism: Study finds slightly higher risk of diagnosis in areas with more lithium in drinking water, but experts say more research is needed",,,,CNN,"A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two.
About 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Scientists still don’t know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder . Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too.

Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition.
Lithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.
A new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.
The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.

As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.
The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.
Experts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.
Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.
“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.
The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.
“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”

Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies – which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water – do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder.
“It’s an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,” said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. “We have to see if there’s a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD.”
Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates . But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder.

A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it’s just the populations who live in more polluted areas.
“There’s a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?” Wiznitzer said. “We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that’s high on our list.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/tech/twitter-blue-checks/index.html,Elon Musk’s Twitter promised a purge of blue check marks. Instead he singled out one account,,,,CNN,"Some VIP Twitter users woke up on Saturday expecting to have lost their coveted blue verification check marks in a previously announced purge by Elon Musk. Instead, Twitter appeared to target a single account from a major publication Musk dislikes and changed the language on its site in a way that obscures why users are verified.
Twitter had said it would “begin winding down” blue checks granted under its old verification system — which emphasized protecting high-profile users at risk of impersonation — on April 1. In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month to join the platform’s Twitter Blue subscription service, which has allowed accounts to pay for verification since December.
Most legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared, but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue.
But one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which had previously told CNN it would not pay for verification.

After an account that often engages with Musk posted a meme this weekend about the Times declining to pay for verification, Musk responded in a tweet saying, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Musk then lashed out at the Times — just the latest instance of the billionaire slamming journalists or media outlets — in a series of tweets that claimed the outlet’s coverage is boring and “propaganda.”
The weekend moves are just the latest example of Twitter creating confusion and whiplash for users over feature changes — and in this case, not just any users, but many of the most high-profile accounts that have long been a key selling point for the platform. It also highlights how Musk often appears to guide decisions about the platform more by whims than by policy.
Although the New York Times’ main account lost its blue check, its other accounts, such as those for its arts, travel and books content, remained verified. (It’s not clear why the New York Times doesn’t have a gold “organizations” check mark, like accounts for other news outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.) After its blue check was removed, a spokesperson for the New York Times reiterated to CNN that it does not plan to pay for verification.
Twitter, which laid off most of its public relations staff last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a separate puzzling move, Twitter’s blue bird logo at the top of the site was replaced on Monday with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The price of dogecoin shot up 20% on Monday.
Musk has been threatening to take away “legacy” blue check marks from users verified under Twitter’s old system since shortly after he bought Twitter last fall.
In early November, Twitter launched the option for people paying for its Twitter Blue subscription service to receive blue checks. The program was quickly put on pause after being plagued by a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators , and was relaunched in December.
Twitter also rolled out a color-coded verification system with differently colored marks for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to say that individual users would eventually have to pay for blue checks.
In the days leading up to the blue check purge that wasn’t, prominent users such as actor William Shatner and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinksy pushed back against the idea that, as power users that draw attention to the site, they should have to pay for a feature that keeps them safe from impersonation.
By muddying the reason accounts are verified, the new label could risk making it easier for people to scam or impersonate high-profile users. Experts in inauthentic behavior have also said it’s not clear that reserving verification for paid users will reduce the number of bots on the site, an issue Musk has raised on and off over the past year.
Musk, for his part, has previously presented changes to Twitter’s verification system as a way of “treating everyone equally.”
“There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities,” he said in a tweet last week. The paid feature could also drive revenue, which could help Musk, who is on the hook for significant debt after buying Twitter for $44 billion.
Musk last week also said that starting on April 15, only verified accounts would be recommended in users’ “For You” feeds alongside the accounts they follow.

Mabel Willis turned 11 on Sunday, and her proud mom marked the occasion by sharing a montage of family photos and videos taken over the years, set to the song “Pictures Of You” by The Cure.
“Happy 11th Birthday Mabel Ray!” Heming Willis wrote in the caption.

“Your energy is infectious,” she continued, praising her little girl for the way she “can light a whole room with your smile and warmth.”
“How you love and care for your family and friends is beautiful to witness. Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup,” Heming Willis added.
Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009. Along with Mabel, the couple also have an 8-year-old daughter, Evelyn. Willis also has daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.
Willis is clearly a doting dad. One picture in Heming Willis’ montage shows the “Die Hard” star holding baby Mabel while planting a kiss on her forehead, while a more recent image shows a beaming Willis hanging out in nature with his preteen.

Heming Willis penned an equally heartfelt tribute last month when her husband celebrated his 68th birthday. Sharing a video montage on Instagram , she referred to the actor as “pure love.”
In February, Willis’ family announced that his speaking disorder, aphasia, had progressed into a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.
“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” they said in an update shared online. “As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”
According to the Alzheimer’s Association, FTD refers to “a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain’s frontal lobes (the areas behind your forehead) or its temporal lobes.” These areas of the brain are generally associated with personality, behavior and language."

Even before the game kicked off, Lionel Messi bore the brunt of the frustrations of some PSG fans who whistled when his name appeared on the big screen during the announcement of the starting lineup.

After Alexadre Lacazette missed a first-half penalty, Bradley Barcola’s goal 10 minutes into the second period was enough to earn Lyon the three points on a night that PSG rarely looked like threatening the visiting goal.
Lens’ 1-0 victory over Rennes and Marseille’s 1-1 draw with Montepellier means both teams are now just six points behind PSG at the top of Ligue 1, and even the domestic title may slip from the team’s grasp.
The reaction of some fans on Sunday must have felt a world away from the adulation and worship Messi received during his recent return to Argentina for friendlies against Panama and Curaçao as the country continued its World Cup celebrations.
Messi’s arrival at the Parc des Princes was supposed to be the missing piece that would help PSG finally win the Champions League, the trophy the club’s Qatari owners crave the most.
So far, the only major trophy the team has won since Messi joined was Ligue 1 last season, a title – it’s fair to say – PSG would likely have won without him.
Messi has 34 goal contributions in all competitions for PSG this season – 18 goals and 17 assists – second only to Mbappé’s 38 and head coach Christophe Galtier refused to lay the blame for the team’s failures at the Argentine’s feet.
“I found it [the jeering] hard to listen to,” Galtier told reporters, per the Athletic. “There may be expectations for Messi and Mbappe to unlock difficult situations. Messi tries very hard, they didn’t all work out; but around him, the other players also need to do their jobs.”
“We can’t expect everything from Leo and Kylian,” he added.

Up next for PSG is a season-defining week as Galtier’s side travels to a Nice team that is unbeaten in 13 matches, before hosting Lens at the Parc des Princes.
PSG has lost two of its three matches since being dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich last month, and only limped past relegation-threatened Brest with a 90th minute Kylian Mbappé winner.
After his team’s victory, Lyon head coach Laurent Blanc said the Champions League or bust mentality has been detrimental to PSG’s performances.
“Paris’ problem is when the No. 1 objective of the Champions League is no longer accessible, it seems that the season no longer exists – and at all levels,” he told reporters."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/football/chelsea-graham-potter-manager-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html,Graham Potter: Premier League breaks record for most sackings in a single season,,,,CNN,"It was just six months ago that Graham Potter was deemed the man to usher in a fresh, exciting era at Chelsea.
The club’s new ownership group , led by American businessman Todd Boehly, had enticed Potter away from Brighton with the promise of managing one of the most lucrative teams in world soccer.
More than $600 million was spent on bringing big-name players to the club and Potter, one of the most exciting young managers in the Premier League, was to mold them into a winning machine.
Related article Chelsea has spent over $600 million on new signings. Here's why that's significant
But, on Sunday, the club announced that it had sacked its manager after an underwhelming spell in charge.
Potter managed to win just 10 of the 28 league matches this season and leaves the team 11th in the Premier League table.
In recent weeks, players had looked a shadow of their former selves and many fans had lost confidence that Potter’s plan for the club could ever work.
Eventually, after previously sticking by its manager, Blues ownership agreed.
“On behalf of everyone at the club, we want to thank Graham sincerely for his contribution to Chelsea,” the club’s co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali said in a statement.
“We have the highest degree of respect for Graham as a coach and as a person. He has always conducted himself with professionalism and integrity and we are all disappointed in this outcome.”
In his previous role as Brighton manager, Potter was given time to stamp his identity on the squad.
The club was punching above its weight financially and, as a result, carefully selected new signings which would compliment Potter’s style of play.
The approach paid off as the team became an established Premier League outfit which has gone on to greater things this season – the Seagulls currently sit sixth in the league and in the UEFA Conference League qualification spot.
At Chelsea, it seemed the complete opposite.
As was the case under previous owner Roman Abramovich, the club expected instant results and used its financial weight to sign a number of high-profile names, including the likes of Enzo Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk .
Despite his impressive CV, Potter had never managed superstars and suddenly found himself in a changing room with multiple.
The scatter gun approach to recruitment also left the team lacking balance and organization with Potter failing to get a tune out of a team busting with talent.
In truth, many had raised an eyebrow when Potter, inexperienced at the very top level, was chosen to replace Thomas Tuchel as manager.
Despite falling out of favor with fans by the end of his tenure, Tuchel had guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021 and is still considered by many as one of the best coaches in the world.
The German has gone on to sign with Bavarian giant Bayern Munich through the 2024/25 season and recently told reporters he needed “quite a bit of time to distance himself from Chelsea” because leaving the club had hurt him.
Related article Bayern Munich sacks manager Julian Nagelsmann, appoints Thomas Tuchel
“Todd [Boehly] said he would be different to Roman [Abramovich],” former Liverpool player and current pundit Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter .
“I feel for Graham Potter, but it was inevitable. You don’t change Tuchel for Potter. Ridiculous decision to start with.”
With 10 games left in the league and a Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on the horizon, Chelsea still has plenty to play for.
Assistant coach Bruno Saltor will take over on an interim basis, but Boehly and his team must now look for a long-term replacement capable – and willing – to bring order to Chelsea’s chaos.
Potter’s sacking is yet another sign of just how transient managers can be in the top-flight of English football, especially when results aren’t instantaneous.
There has now been a record 12 sackings in the Premier League so far this season, with Potter leaving his position the same day Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was sacked from his.
The previous record was 10 manager changes in a single season, set in four other campaigns, most recently in 2017/18."

Reese could be seen approaching Clark before moving her open hand in front of her face – popularized by WWE star John Cena to mean “you can’t see me” – before pointing to her ring finger in a gesture some interpreted as a reference to the place her newly-acquired championship ring might sit.

Clark made a similar gesture to another player earlier in the tournament.
The gesture has sparked much debate, especially on social media. Some have criticized Reese, while others have defended her actions, highlighting how there was no public outrage in response to Clark’s gesture earlier in the tournament.
Sports journalist Jose de Jesus Ortiz called Reese’s actions “classless,” while former ESPN host Keith Olbermann called Reese an “idiot” for the gesture.
In the press conference after the victory, Reese referenced the difference in reaction she received as a result of her gesture as compared to the one Clark received.
“All year, I was critiqued for who I was. I don’t fit the narrative,” Reese said. “I don’t fit the box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. Y’all told me that all year. But when other people do it, and y’all don’t say nothing.
“So this is for the girls that look like me. For those that want to speak up for what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. And that’s what I did it for tonight. It was bigger than me tonight. And Twitter is going to go into a rage every time.
“And I’m happy. I feel like I’ve helped grow women’s basketball this year. (…) I’m looking forward to celebrating and then next season.”

Reese had 15 points and 10 rebounds in the 102-85 victory and won the women’s March Madness’ Most Outstanding Player award.
In the post-game broadcast, Reese referenced the similar gesture Clark made to a Louisville opponent in the Elite Eight.
In the same game, Clark said to an opponent: “You’re down by 15 points. Shut up,” according to the Bleacher Report.
“Caitlin Clark is a hell of a player but I don’t take disrespect lightly,” Reese said. “She disrespected [LSU’s] Alexis [Morris] (…) and I wanted to pick her pocket. But I had a moment at the end of her game. I was in my bag, I was in my moment.”
After the Championship game, Clark herself said she didn’t notice anything at the time.
“I was just trying to get to the handshake line and shake hands and be grateful that my team was in that position,” Clark said in the post-game press conference. “All the credit in the world to LSU. They were tremendous. They deserve it. They had a tremendous season.
“(LSU head coach) Kim Mulkey coached them so, so well. She’s one of the best basketball coaches of all time, and it shows. She only said really kind things to me in the handshake line, so I’m very grateful of that too.
“But honestly I have no idea. I was just trying to spend the last few moments on the court with especially the five people that I’ve started 93 games with and relishing every second of that.”
LSU head coach Mulkey said she had “no clue” about what transpired.
Among those defending Reese on social media were ESPN’s Holly Rowe and former NBA star Etan Thomas.
“People hating on Angel Reese or Caitlin Clark. Stop. Unapologetically confident young women should be celebrated NOT hated. Get used to it,” Rowe wrote on Twitter.
Former Washington Wizards, Oklahoma City Thunder and Atlanta Hawks player Thomas wrote : “Hold on now!!!! It was cute when Caitlin Clark did it. Y’all didn’t have any issues with it at all. So don’t be all outraged and talking about class and sportsmanship when Angel Reese does the same thing. We’re not doing double standards here.”
Reese said the negative reaction on social media throughout the season has helped fuel her excellent season, having finished averaging 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds in her first season with LSU after transferring from Maryland.
“Twitter can say what they want to say,” she said. “I love reading those comments. I have all the screenshots of what everybody has said about me all season. What are you going to say now?”"

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/golf/rory-mcilroy-masters-meltdown-2011-spt-spc-intl/index.html,The haunting Masters meltdown that changed Rory McIlroy’s career,,,,CNN,"Editor’s Note: This story was originally published in April 2023.
Slumped on his club, head buried in his arm, Rory McIlroy looked on the verge of tears.
The then-21-year-old had just watched his ball sink into the waters of Rae’s Creek at Augusta National and with it, his dream of winning The Masters , a dream that had looked so tantalizingly close mere hours earlier.
As a four-time major winner and one of the most decorated names in the sport’s history, few players would turn down the chance to swap places with McIlroy heading into Augusta this week.
Yet on Sunday afternoon of April 10, 2011, not a golfer in the world would have wished to be in the Northern Irishman’s shoes.
A fresh-faced, mop-headed McIlroy had touched down in Georgia for the first major of the season with a reputation as the leading light of the next generation of stars.
An excellent 2010 had marked his best season since turning pro three years earlier, highlighted by a first PGA Tour win at the Quail Hollow Championship and a crucial contribution to Team Europe’s triumph at the Ryder Cup.
Yet despite a pair of impressive top-three finishes at the Open and PGA Championship respectively, a disappointing missed cut at The Masters – his first at a major – served as ominous foreshadowing.
McIlroy shot 74 and 77 to fall four strokes short of the cut line at seven-over par, a performance that concerned him enough to take a brief sabbatical from competition.
But one year on in 2011, any lingering Masters demons looked to have been exorcised as McIlroy flew round the Augusta fairways.
Having opened with a bogey-free seven-under 65 – the first time he had ever shot in the 60s at the major – McIlroy pulled ahead from Spanish first round co-leader Alvaro Quirós with a second round 69.
It sent him into the weekend holding a two-shot cushion over Australia’s Jason Day, with Tiger Woods a further stroke behind and back in the hunt for a 15th major after a surging second round 66.
And yet the 21-year-old leader looked perfectly at ease with having a target on his back. Even after a tentative start to the third round, McIlroy rallied with three birdies across the closing six holes to stretch his lead to four strokes heading into Sunday.
The youngster was out on his own ahead of a bunched chasing pack comprising Day, Ángel Cabrera, K.J. Choi and Charl Schwartzel. After 54 holes, McIlroy had shot just three bogeys.
“It’s a great position to be in … I’m finally feeling comfortable on this golf course,” McIlroy told reporters.
“I’m not getting ahead of myself, I know how leads can dwindle away very quickly. I have to go out there, not take anything for granted and go out and play as hard as I’ve played the last three days. If I can do that, hopefully things will go my way.
“We’ll see what happens tomorrow because four shots on this golf course isn’t that much.”
The truth can hurt, and McIlroy was about to prove his assessment of Augusta to be true in the most excruciating way imaginable.
His fourth bogey of the week arrived immediately. Having admitted to expecting some nerves at the first tee, McIlroy sparked a booming opening drive down the fairway, only to miss his putt from five feet.
Three consecutive pars steadied the ship, but Schwartzel had the wind in his sails. A blistering birdie, par, eagle start had seen him draw level at the summit after his third hole.
A subsequent bogey from the South African slowed his charge, as McIlroy clung onto a one-shot lead at the turn from Schwartzel, Cabrera, Choi, and a rampaging Woods, who shot five birdies and an eagle across the front nine to send Augusta into a frenzy.
Despite his dwindling advantage and the raucous Tiger-mania din ahead of him, McIlroy had responded well to another bogey at the 5th hole, draining a brilliant 20-foot putt at the 7th to restore his lead.
The fist pump that followed marked the high-water point of McIlroy’s round, as a sliding start accelerated into full-blown free-fall at the par-four 10th hole.
His tee shot went careening into a tree, ricocheting to settle between the white cabins that separate the main course from the adjacent par-three course. It offered viewers a glimpse at a part of Augusta rarely seen on broadcast, followed by pictures of McIlroy anxiously peering out from behind a tree to track his follow-up shot.
Though his initial escape was successful, yet another collision with a tree and a two-putt on the green saw a stunned McIlroy eventually tap in for a triple bogey. Having led the field one hole and seven shots earlier, he arrived at the 11th tee in seventh.
By the time his tee drive at the 13th plopped into the creek, all thoughts of who might be the recipient of the green jacket had long-since switched away from the anguished youngster. It had taken him seven putts to navigate the previous two greens, as a bogey and a double bogey dropped him to five-under – the score he had held after just 11 holes of the tournament.
Mercifully, the last five holes passed without major incident. A missed putt for birdie from five feet at the final hole summed up McIlroy’s day, though he was given a rousing reception as he left the green.

Mere minutes earlier, the same crowd had erupted as Schwartzel sunk his fourth consecutive birdie to seal his first major title. After starting the day four shots adrift of McIlroy, the South African finished 10 shots ahead of him, and two ahead of second-placed Australian duo Jason Day and Adam Scott.
McIlroy’s eight-over 80 marked the highest score of the round. Having headlined the leaderboard for most of the week, he finished tied-15th.
Tears would flow during a phone call with his parents the following morning, but at his press conference, McIlroy was upbeat.
“I’m very disappointed at the minute, and I’m sure I will be for the next few days, but I’ll get over it,” he said.
“I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled … It’s a Sunday at a major, what it can do.
“This is my first experience at it, and hopefully the next time I’m in this position I’ll be able to handle it a little better. I didn’t handle it particularly well today obviously, but it was a character-building day … I’ll come out stronger for it.”
Once again, McIlroy would be proven right.
Just eight weeks later in June, McIlroy rampaged to an eight-shot victory at the US Open. Records tumbled in his wake at Congressional, as he shot a tournament record 16-under 268 to become the youngest major winner since Tiger Woods at The Masters in 1997.
The historic victory kickstarted a golden era for McIlroy. After coasting to another eight-shot win at the PGA Championship in 2012, McIlroy became only the third golfer since 1934 to win three majors by the age of 25 with triumph at the 2014 Open Championship.
Before the year was out, he would add his fourth major title with another PGA Championship win.
And much of it was owed to that fateful afternoon at Augusta. In an interview with the BBC in 2015, McIlroy dubbed it “the most important day” of his career.
“If I had not had the whole unravelling, if I had just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one, I would not have learned as much.
“Luckily, it did not take me long to get into a position like that again when I was leading a major and I was able to get over the line quite comfortably. It was a huge learning curve for me and I needed it, and thankfully I have been able to move on to bigger and better things.
“Looking back on what happened in 2011, it doesn’t seem as bad when you have four majors on your mantelpiece.”
McIlroy’s contentment came with a caveat: it would be “unthinkable” if he did not win The Masters in his career.
Yet as he prepares for his 15th appearance at Augusta National this week, a green jacket remains an elusive missing item from his wardrobe.
Despite seven top-10 finishes in his past 10 Masters outings, the trophy remains the only thing separating McIlroy from joining the ranks of golf immortals to have completed golf’s career grand slam of all four majors in the modern era: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.
A runner-up finish to Scottie Scheffler last year marked McIlroy’s best finish at Augusta, yet arguably 2011 remains the closest he has ever been to victory. A slow start in 2022 meant McIlroy had begun Sunday’s deciding round 10 shots adrift of the American, who teed off for his final hole with a five-shot lead despite McIlroy’s brilliant 64 finish.

At 33 years old, time is still on his side. Though 2022 extended his major drought to eight years, it featured arguably his best golf since that golden season in 2014.
And as McIlroy knows better than most, things can change quickly at Augusta National."

Senior guard Tristen Newton led UConn (31-8) with 19 points and 10 rebounds while Final Four Most Outstanding Player Adama Sanogo, a junior forward, chipped in with 17 points and 10 rebounds.
“We weren’t ranked going into the year so we had the chip on our shoulder,” UConn head coach Dan Hurley told game broadcaster CBS. “We knew the level that we could play at, even through those dark times,” he added, referencing the team’s six losses in eight games during the regular season.
He said going into the tournament his group had confidence garnered during the season.
“And when you have the type of leaders like Andre Jackson (game-high six assists Monday) and Adama Sanogo, they kept this team together, got us back on track and we knew we were the best team in the tournament going in and we just had to play to our level,” he added.
San Diego State (32-7) was topped by Keshad Johnson who had 14 points.
UConn trailed very early but San Diego State was undone by an 11-minute, eight-second stretch in which they scored just five free throws and missed 12 consecutive shots from the field. The Huskies went from down 10-6 to up 36-24 at halftime.
The Aztecs made a run midway through the second half and narrowed the deficit to five at 60-55 with 5:19 to play but the Huskies scored the next nine to take a comfortable lead into the final two minutes.
“We battled. Battled back to five in the second half, but gave them too much separation,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “We had to be at our best. We weren’t at our best. A lot had to do with UConn.”
Senior guard Adam Seiko told reporters they gave themselves a chance with their second half comeback but UConn “just made a little bit more plays” at the end.
“They have a lot of weapons. They were pretty good,” said Matt Bradley, also a senior guard. “To beat them, we had to make shots. I shot poorly. And you had to have a really good game to beat those dudes on the offensive end.”
UConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 10 points, with its closest game being a 13-point win over the University of Miami in the national semifinals.
“I just want to thank my teammates, my coaches who believed in me. If it were not for them I would not be here right now,” Sanogo told CBS.
Jordan Hawkins, who scored 16 points for UConn, talked about winning the crown one day after his cousin, Angel Reese of Louisiana State University, won the women’s title .
“I mean it’s absolutely amazing that we both get this opportunity and I mean the family reunion is going to be great so that’s all I know,” he said.
UConn enters rarefied air as only the sixth team to win five NCAA men’s basketball championships, joining UCLA (11), Kentucky (eight), North Carolina (six), Duke (five) and Indiana (five). All of UConn’s titles have come since 1999 with the most recent before Monday occurring in 2014.
UConn’s women’s teams have won 11 basketball national titles.

The legendary star in the genre used her acceptance speech for the Equal Play Award at Sunday’s CMT Awards to call for more equity and diversity in the country music industry.
“When I wrote the phrase ‘Man I feel like a woman’ I honestly had no idea at the time it would become an undercurrent of a decades-long career,” she said, referring to one of her biggest hits. “It’s amazing how one statement can empower so many.”
The phrase, Twain said, “has been adopted by an array of fantastic communities all around the world and become a genuine path of power…which brings me so much joy.”
“I believe in an all-inclusive country music. We’re family,” Twain said. “This is a genre of music with a rich history that raised and nurtured my own songwriting and performance and recording career from childhood. Currently, the industry standard does a real disservice to this.”
Twain, who was presented the award by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, shouted out some of the diverse acts she is spotlighting on her “Queen of Me” tour this year, including Lily Rose, Lindsay Ell, Hailey Whitters, Mickey Guyton and others.
“I will continue to do my best as a trailblazer,” Twain said. “Together, let’s ensure all our fellow artists get equal play regardless of gender, age or race.”
She also performed acappella with the African American singing group, The BoykinZ, while presenting an award onstage. Twain connected with the group, who are sisters and rising country stars, after Kelly Clarkson surprised them recently by bringing Twain out to meet them during an episode of Clarkson’s daytime talk show."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,Last-minute tax-filing tips | CNN Business,,,,CNN,"So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022.
That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.
Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.
Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.
If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.

Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit . (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.
Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.
Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:
Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).
If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.
Here are some of the tax forms you may have received:
“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.
One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.
Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer .
Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.
What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.
Related article Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why
Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.
So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.
You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.
Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.
If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.
You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee . Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.
If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/economy/march-retail-sales/index.html,Retail spending fell in March as consumers pull back,,,,CNN,"Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.
Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.
Investors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.
That led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.
However, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.
Smaller tax returns likely played a role in last month’s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.
“March is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.
Credit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.
Enhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.
Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month’s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.
Still, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.
“The big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,” Meyer said.
Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February — but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.
The job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
For consumers, the effects of last month’s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then.
The latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.
“On net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release.
“Consumers are expecting a downturn, they’re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/media/fox-news-dominion-hnk-intl/index.html,Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone,,,,CNN,"This is it.
The media defamation trial of the century is on the precipice of kicking off in Wilmington, Delaware, in just days.
Jury selection in Dominion Voting Systems’ monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit took place all of Thursday, with 300 potential jurors being summoned to court. Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as scheduled on Monday.
It is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case.
A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
It’s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way.
I’ve covered Fox News for a while now. I’ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel’s programming. I’ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing’s furthest fringes.
The network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before.
But this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument.
Fox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking “the media” on-air.
In this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won’t be pretty. The case hasn’t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox’s legal team and put them on notice.
Perhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/business/silicon-valley-bank-entrepreneurs-of-color-reaj/index.html,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color,,,,CNN,"When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.
As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited.
SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color.
Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, “we’re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we’re going to get hit harder.”
Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America’s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States.
Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.
SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.
“When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,” said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.
Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.
Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey , a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.
In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.
“We know there’s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that’s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,” Martinez told CNN.
Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB’s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said.
Immigrant founders often don’t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn’t recognize them.
“The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, ‘Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,’” Bradley said.
Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the “top four banks” — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.
In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the “top four banks” when her brother co-signed for her.
“The top four don’t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that’s why we’ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,” Bradley said.
None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.
Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country.
Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank’s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities.
The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks.
Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks.
OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets.
Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders.
“I said, ‘Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,’ because I am all three,” Hamilton told CNN.
Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase .
But Bradley, who is also an ‘angel investor’ of minority-owned businesses, said she remains “really hopeful” that community banks, regional banks and fintechs “will all stand up and say, ‘Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.’”"
https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/us/lake-powell-capacity-shrinking-drought-climate/index.html,"Lake Powell’s total capacity is shrinking, report shows",,,,CNN,"Lake Powell , the second-largest human-made reservoir in the US, has lost nearly 7% of its potential storage capacity since 1963, when Glen Canyon Dam was built, a new report shows.
In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought , the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found , Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.
That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.
The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers , according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold.
As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.
It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months.
Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows , triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January.
And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity.
The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated.
The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.
“It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/world/air-pollution-2021-iqair-report-climate/index.html,IQAir report shows the best and worst places for air quality in 2021,,,,CNN,"Air pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.
The report by IQAir , a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines , which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.
Related article Not only is Lake Powell's water level plummeting because of drought, its total capacity is shrinking, too
Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.
The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.
In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.
“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”
Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir .
It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines , which were updated in September 2021 . The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.
PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma , heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.

Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.
IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.
In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.
“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.
Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.
“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”

Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.
China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.
The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest , which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.
“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.
The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.
“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.

Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.
Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.
“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.
Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.
“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by installing solar panels on their roofs. So why aren’t more of them doing it?,,,,CNN,"As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources , many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.
The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.
At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company . (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)

As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.
Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.
Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.
The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.
“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable , told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”
Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities .
Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.

CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?
Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.
The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.
“We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.”
Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.
It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.
“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.”
Johanna Neumann, Environment America
Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.
Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.
“Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.”
According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.
Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report . It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said.
Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.
Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.
“My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.”
Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.
Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.
“We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.
CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.
Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.
“For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”

Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House , said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.
“Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load.
“We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.”
For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.
Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.
The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.
In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.

“One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.”
Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.”
Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.
Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.
“The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.”

Related gallery Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute'
Online voters selected her from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes .
Cheboi’s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers — and the chance at a brighter future.
Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said “worked really hard to educate us.” At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage  that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up.
As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday’s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.
Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. “I know the pain of poverty,” said Cheboi, 29. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.”
A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.

Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.
“When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she told CNN.
Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.
“I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said.
Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which  computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.

“We have kids here (in Kenya) — myself included, back in the day — who don’t even know what a computer is,” she said.
So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya — in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.
“At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said.
A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.
The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it’s shipped to Kenya. There, it’s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.
“We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.”
The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.
“My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.”
CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters.
“We’re so deeply honored to be here,” said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. “Diane wrote this incredible anthem ‘Applause’ for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.”
Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly , who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,” Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US – food that would otherwise be wasted – to those who need it. “In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,” Plaza added.

The Fulton County Jail’s chief jailer and two assistant chief jailers submitted their resignations at the request of Sheriff Patrick “Pat” Labat during an executive staff meeting over the weekend, a statement from the sheriff’s office said without naming them.
“It’s clear to me that it’s time, past time, to clean house,” Labat said in the Monday statement announcing “sweeping changes” at the facility.
The resignations come as the family of Lashawn Thompson demands a criminal investigation into his September 2022 death at the jail in Atlanta and for a new facility to be built.
Related article Family says deplorable conditions and insect bites in Atlanta jail contributed to inmate's death
Thompson’s family said his death was the result of unsanitary conditions at the jail and complications from insect bites. “The cell he was in was not fit for a diseased animal. This is inexcusable and it’s deplorable,” family attorney Michael Harper said at a news conference last week while holding photos that purportedly showed the conditions of Thompson’s jail cell.
“The manner and cause of death was listed as ‘undetermined’ by the county medical examiner. A full investigation was launched into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Thompson’s death,” the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Thursday.
Due to health privacy regulations, the sheriff’s office couldn’t share any information about Thompson’s health condition when he was arrested, “or what decisions he made regarding his right to accept or refuse medical care,” the statement said.
Labat asked for the jail officials’ resignations after reviewing preliminary evidence gathered during the internal investigation, he said in the Monday statement.
“Collectively, the executive team that’s been in place has more than 65 years of jail administration and law enforcement experience. When leveraged at its very best, that experience can be invaluable. However, it can also lend itself to complacency, stagnation & settling for the status quo,” the statement read.
Additionally, the sheriff’s office is “reviewing all legal options to change medical vendors and enter into a new contract with a provider that can effectively, consistently and compassionately deliver the best standard of care,” the statement said.
On Friday, the sheriff’s office said “several immediate actions” had already been taken, including a $500,000 emergency expense “to address the infestation of bed bugs, lice and other vermin” within the jail. A process to transfer more than 600 inmates to other counties “in an effort to help relieve overcrowding, at an average cost of approximately $40K/day,” had also begun, the sheriff’s office said.
Thompson had been at the jail for about three months prior to his death and was housed in the psychiatric wing because he suffered from mental health issues, Harper, the family attorney said. He was being held on a misdemeanor assault charge.
The 35-year-old was born in Winter Haven, Florida, and had been living in Atlanta off and on in recent years, his brother, Brad McCrae, said at the news conference. Thompson loved listening to music and cooking, McCrae said.

When asked by a reporter what he thought when he saw images of his brother’s body and the conditions of his cell, McCrae said, “It was heartbreaking because nobody should be seen like that. Nobody should see that. But the first thing that entered my mind was Emmett Till .”
The internal Office of Professional Standards investigation and one being conducted by the Atlanta Police Department, which was the responding agency, are underway, the sheriff’s office said Monday. “Once those investigations are completed, the full investigative package will be handed over to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations for review,” the statement read.
“The final investigative report will not ease the family’s grief or bring their loved one back, but it is my hope and expectation that it provides a full, accurate and transparent account of the facts surrounding Mr. Thompson’s death so that it provides all of the answers they are seeking and deserve,” Labat said in the statement."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/us/crosley-green-prison-return/index.html,Crosley Green returns to prison in Florida two years after his release,,,,CNN,"A Florida man who served three decades behind bars for a murder he says he didn’t commit returned to prison Monday after spending the past two years building a life outside prison walls.
Since his conditional release in 2021 amid appeals, Crosley Green , 65, had held a job at a machine grafting facility, attended church and spent time with his grandchildren. He even fell in love.
“I’ve been with this man for two years,” his fiancée, Kathy Spikes, told CNN. “To not be able to have a 5 o’clock phone call to say, ‘I’m home,’ for me to say, ‘What do you want for dinner,’ that’s what I’m anxious about.”
His return to prison came about two weeks after US District Judge Roy Dalton ruled he must turn himself in to the authorities by April 17 to resume his life sentence.
Green surrendered to Florida’s Department of Corrections at 5 p.m. Monday, according to his attorneys. He was accompanied by Spikes, family members and his lawyers Keith Harrison and Jeane Thomas, who have represented him pro bono for 15 years.
Green was allowed to leave prison on conditional release in 2021, about three years after a federal court in Orlando overturned his conviction. The state of Florida appealed that decision and won last year, and Green’s conviction was reinstated. Dalton allowed Green to remain free while he exhausted his legal options. Green’s legal team petitioned the US Supreme Court, but in late February the court declined to hear his case.
Related article A federal appeals court says Crosley Green's disputed murder conviction can stand, but the 64-year-old has no intention of giving up the fight
“I can’t be angry at no one,” Green told CNN. “I don’t want no one else to be angry at no one. Anger isn’t going to take you nowhere. Ain’t going to do (anything) but harm you. I’m happy. I’m not happy about going back. I’ve got my future wife, I’ve got my friends that came up here with me. I’ve got my family.”
Green was convicted in the 1989 shooting death of 21-year-old Charles Flynn. Green, who is Black, was sentenced to death by an all-White jury , then resentenced to life in prison in 2009 due to a technicality related to the sentencing phase of his trial.
In 2018, Judge Dalton ruled prosecutors had improperly withheld evidence that police at one point suspected someone else was the shooter. But late last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and reinstated Green’s conviction, saying the withheld evidence was not material to the case.
Green’s only options for remaining out of prison now are clemency or parole, according to his legal team.
“We think he’s an outstanding candidate for parole,” Thomas said. “He’s demonstrated that in the last two years he’s been under supervised release. He’s been an incredibly successful person on the outside with his work, his church and his family.”
Thomas has pointed out that clemency is not the same as exoneration. She says it is just a mechanism through which the state decides someone has served enough time behind bars to be released.
Since his release, Green has worn an ankle monitor and been “a model citizen,” according to Thomas.
“For 15 years now, we have believed wholeheartedly, 100 percent in the innocence of our client,” Thomas said. “As lawyers, we have to believe that the justice system will get it right. We’re going to keep fighting. This is a grave injustice. And we just believe that eventually we will get it right.”
Despite the latest ruling, Green remains optimistic in his fight to prove his innocence. In a statement shared by his lawyers with CNN, he said, “To me, it’s just another part of what I’m going through now to get my freedom. That’s all it is.”
He further attributed his perseverance to his faith in comments to CNN.
“If everyone can just believe in themselves the way I believe in myself, with the Lord, then you can understand and say the things that I can say by not letting anything come between you and your faith,” he said.

It was a spoof website and now he’s facing charges",,,,CNN,"A Tennessee Air National Guardsman is facing charges after applying to be a hitman on a spoof “rent-a-hitman” website, according to the Department of Justice.
Josiah Ernesto Garcia, 21, was charged Thursday after submitting an employment inquiry to the website rentahitman.com, which is a parody site that includes “testimonials” from purportedly satisfied hit-man customers.
The website was originally created in 2005 to “advertise a cyber security startup company,” the Justice Department said in a news release . “The company failed and over the next decade it received many inquiries about murder-for-hire services.”
Garcia indicated in February that he had “military experience, and rifle expertise” and requested an “in depth job description,” according to a criminal complaint filed Thursday.
“Garcia followed up on this initial request and submitted other identification documents and a resume, indicating he was an expert marksman and employed in the Air National Guard since July 2021. The resume also indicated that Garcia was nicknamed “Reaper,” which was earned from his military experience and marksmanship, the Department of Justice said in the news release.
Garcia sent another follow-up email days later, saying he didn’t hear back after submitting a resume, according to the complaint.
According to investigators, Garcia wrote in the email, “Why I want this Job* Im looking for a job, that pays well, related to my military experience (Shooting and Killing the marked target) so I can support my kid on the way. What can I say, I enjoy doing what I do, so if I can find a job that is similar to it, (such as this one) put me in coach!”
After Garcia sent more follow-up emails, the website owner – at the direction of the FBI – responded with an email saying, “Josiah, a Field Coordinator will be in touch in the near future. You will receive a message when they are ready. Timing is based on client needs,” according to the complaint.
On April 5, an FBI undercover agent contacted Garcia for a phone interview, during which he asked, “How soon can I start?” and “What do the payments look like?” according to the complaint.
The undercover agent asked Garcia if he was comfortable with taking fingers or ears as trophies or performing torture at a client’s request.
“If it’s possible and in my means to do so, I’m more than capable,” Garcia said, according to the complaint.
In an in-person meeting with the undercover agent on Wednesday, Garcia “was presented with a ‘target package’ consisting of photographs and a description of a fictional target’s name, weight, age, height, address, and employment information,” the complaint said.
Garcia was told the target was the client’s husband, who was abusive to her, and that the client was paying $5,000 for the job with a down payment of $2,500, the complaint said.
“After agreeing to the terms of the murder arrangement, Garcia asked the agent if he needed to provide a photograph of the dead body,” according to the Justice Department release. “Garcia was then arrested by FBI agents, who in a subsequent search of his home, recovered an AR style rifle.”
Garcia is charged with the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, the Justice Department said.
CNN has been unable to reach Garcia’s attorney for comment. Garcia is set to appear in court on Tuesday afternoon.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/us/lawsuit-indianapolis-fedex-mass-shooting/index.html,Family of victim and survivors of Indianapolis FedEx mass shooting file lawsuit against gun magazine manufacturer and distributors,,,,CNN,"The family of a victim and several survivors of a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis filed a lawsuit against companies involved in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of the high capacity magazine used by the gunman who killed 8 people and injured several others in 2021.
The federal lawsuit, filed in US District Court in the Western District of New York, targets a gun distributor and magazine manufacturers, and alleges the companies recklessly marketed and sold their products to impulsive young men at risk of violence.
The gunman in the April 15, 2021, attack, Brandon Hole, 19, was previously employed at the facility and opened fire on his former coworkers before killing himself. About a year before the attack, Hole browsed White supremacist websites, CNN previously reported . His mother contacted the police in March 2020 because she was worried about his behavior and threatening statements he’d made after he purchased a gun, according to police.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday on behalf of the estate of Jaswinder Singh, who was killed during the shooting, Harpreet Singh, who was injured, and his wife Dilpreet Kaur, and Lakhwinder Kaur, who was also injured in the attack. They are each seeking at least $75,000 from the lawsuit and are asking for a jury trial, according to the complaint.
The lawsuit targets American Tactical Inc., an American firearms importer, manufacturer and seller, along with the company’s president and the director of marketing and purchasing. Schmeisser GmbH, a German firearms manufacturer; and 365 Plus d.o.o., a Slovenian company that designs, produces and distributes firearms accessories and other tactical equipment are also listed as defendants.
The three companies were involved in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of the 60-round high-capacity magazines that “have been used repeatedly to slaughter and terrorize Americans in horrific mass shootings since long before April 2021,” the lawsuit says.
The lawsuit claims these companies made these magazines easily accessible to Hole and targeted their marketing campaign to “a consumer base filled with impulsive young men who feel they need to harm others in order to prove their strength and who have militaristic delusions of fighting in a war or a video game.”
“This case is about what happens when companies recklessly design, market, sell, and distribute these accessories to the general public—indiscriminately—and without adherence to reasonable safeguards,” the lawsuit reads.
American Tactical declined to comment to CNN about the lawsuit. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests.
Schmeisser GmbH manufactured the magazine used in the mass shooting and distributed it in the US through American Tactical and 365 Plus, the lawsuit claims.
“The high capacity of the magazine emboldened the shooter to commit the attack, knowing he had the ability to fire 60 rounds continuously without the need to pause to reload,” the lawsuit says.
The complaint says American Tactical promoted marketing videos that show men dressed in tactical vests similar to what Hole wore during the 2021 attack as they fire “a constant stream of bullets at unseen targets in various offensive, tactical operations.”

The lawsuit alleges the firearm companies placed an “unreasonably dangerous product on the market without sufficient safeguards to prevent its foreseeable unlawful use.”
The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the gun control advocacy organization that employs two of several lawyers representing the plaintiffs, wrote in a statement to CNN the nonprofit is “trying to achieve justice for these survivors and their family, and hold American Tactical, Inc. accountable for their irresponsible marketing and sales practices.”
“If you decide to sell such highly lethal products to the general public anyway, you need to be very careful about who you’re selling them to. As we allege in our complaint, defendants here have instead taken a hard turn and specifically marketed their highly lethal products to a dangerous class of individuals,” said Philip Bangle, the Brady Center’s senior litigation council."

The filing means that after the Justice Department files a response expected Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, the court may rule at any time as the legal battle over mifepristone continues, nearly two weeks after a federal judge in Texas said the drug should not have been approved in 2000.
Last week, Justice Samuel Alito granted a request of the Biden administration and a manufacturer of the drug to put a temporary hold on the decision to give the justices more time to review the case. Alito asked to hear from the doctors and said the court would make its final determination by 11:59 p.m ET on Wednesday.

In the filing, the doctors asked the justices to ultimately deny the request from the Biden administration, arguing that for “nearly a quarter-century” the government and a manufacturer of the drug “have brazenly flouted the law and applicable regulations, disregarded holes and red flags in their own safety data, intentionally evaded judicial review, and continually placed politics above women’s health.”
Erik C. Baptist, a lawyer for the doctors, said that the US Food and Drug Administration had not done enough to study the safety of the drug.
“Across decades, the agency has stripped away every meaningful and necessary safeguard on chemical abortion, demonstrating callous disregard for women’s well-being, unborn life, and statutory limits.”
He said that the government’s argument amount to a “sky-is-falling-argument that compares chemical abortion to drugs like ibuprofen” and that the lower court rulings that restrict access to the drug were “meticulous decisions” that, he argued, “merely require the agency to follow the law.  “"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/mccarthy-debt-limit-plan/index.html,McCarthy makes plea for Republicans to back debt ceiling plan,,,,CNN,"Speaker Kevin McCarthy made a plea to House Republicans during a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning to back his debt ceiling plan , telling them that although it doesn’t have to include everything they want, it will help get him to the negotiating table with President Joe Biden.
McCarthy also told members that once he is at the table, he can push for other policy provisions down the road, according to multiple sources in the room, underscoring the idea that leadership sees the GOP-only plan as purely a way to strengthen their hand at the negotiating table.
Top House Republicans are projecting confidence that they will be able to unite the conference behind a plan and move quickly to pass it. But that is far from certain. Key details of the plan are still yet to be finalized and some members are expressing frustration over the proposal as it stands – and elements that have not been included.
House Rules Chairman Tom Cole told CNN the GOP debt limit bill will be on the House floor next week, but other House Republicans have signaled skepticism over whether specifics of the proposal can be ironed out in time for a vote to happen that soon and the timeframe may slip.
House Republicans are insisting that any increase in the debt limit must be paired with spending cuts, while the White House argues that the limit should be raised without any conditions. McCarthy wants to move a debt limit bill through the House as a way to put pressure on the White House to come to the table for negotiation, even if the bill won’t pass the Democratic-controlled Senate.
The closed-door meeting kicks off a difficult push by GOP leaders to wrangle 218 votes for a proposal to raise the debt ceiling and reduce federal spending. McCarthy walked members through his proposal, which includes clawing back unspent Covid-19 funds, 10-year caps on spending, prohibiting Biden’s student loan forgiveness and enacting a GOP energy bill.
Conservatives are pushing for more to be included while some have said they won’t back a debt ceiling hike under any circumstances, illustrating how challenging it is going to be for GOP leaders to unite the conference behind a proposal.
GOP Rep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, expressed frustration over the lack of specificity from House GOP leaders on their debt ceiling and spending cut plan.
“I don’t know what’s in the package completely, that’s the issue,” Perry told reporters. “I know what was on the screen, but I don’t think that’s the entire package.”
Perry also said he disagreed with GOP leadership’s approach of trying to pass something now in order to get to the negotiating table with Democrats and then demanding more later. Perry was one of several members who stood up during the closed-door conference meeting and advocated for additional cuts.
Rep. Kevin Hern, the leader of the Republican Study Committee, told CNN that Republicans have to come together on one debt ceiling plan or face a much weaker hand in any future negotiations with the White House.
“It’s about leadership. If we can’t lead then we have a problem,” Hern said.
Hern said he had no problem with voting as soon as next week, arguing it’s time for Republicans to coalesce.
GOP Rep. Don Bacon said one of the things they are still debating is how – and how long – to raise the debt ceiling, and whether they should raise it by a dollar amount or to a date. Some members are pushing for a shorter increase, but Bacon said it will likely go into next year.
He also confirmed some members are still pushing to include more spending cuts and repeals, and some lawmakers advocated for that during the meeting, but Bacon predicted the 18 Republicans in Biden districts, like himself, will be for it.
Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said that conference talks on the debt ceiling were “getting closer,” but that there are still details that need to be addressed. He said he’s not sure a vote on the budget deal can come as early as next week.
“I think a lot of that depends on how these discussions go today, tomorrow, the following day,” he said. “I think there are a number of really critical details that we’ve still got to work out before making a final decision on a vote, but it’s been a very productive discussion, a lot of good ideas” though he said he would be “very surprised” if bill text was released today.
A source inside the room tells CNN that inside the House GOP conference, members of the House Freedom Caucus including Reps. Perry, Chip Roy and Andrew Clyde called for more cuts to be included and pushed leadership on why some provisions weren’t included.
It goes to show how hard this is going to be for leaders even though leadership has pitched this as an opportunity to strengthen leverage with the White House.
One of the topics discussed during the GOP conference meeting was why a few items were not included in the debt ceiling framework.
For example, conservatives have been frustrated a measure that would claw back Internal Revenue Service enforcement funds wasn’t included. But a source in the room tells CNN that the reason it isn’t included is because it would be scored by the Congressional Budget Office as expensive and without enforcement money, the CBO would argue less tax revenue would be collected.
Republicans are trying to raise as much revenue as they can and cut spending in this bill.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/groff-dejoy-supreme-court-religious-liberty/index.html,Supreme Court seems sympathetic to postal worker who didn’t work Sundays in dispute over religious accommodations,,,,CNN,"The Supreme Court seemed to side with a former mail carrier, an evangelical Christian, who says the US Postal Service failed to accommodate his request to not work on Sundays.
A lower court had ruled against the worker, Gerald Groff, holding that his request would cause an “undue burden” on the USPS and lead to low morale at the workplace when other employees had to pick up his shifts.
But during oral arguments on Tuesday, there appeared to be consensus, after almost two hours of oral arguments, that the appeals court had been too quick to rule against Groff.
There seemed to be, as Justice Elena Kagan put it, some level of “kumbaya-ing” between the justices on the bench at times.
But as justices sought to land on a test that lower courts could use to clarify how far employers must go to accommodate their employees’ religious beliefs, differences arose when a lawyer for Groff suggested that the court overturn decades-old precedent. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito seemed open to the prospect.
Critically, however, Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh were sympathetic to arguments made by the Postal Service that granting Groff’s request might cause morale to plummet among the other employees. Kavanaugh noted that “morale” among employers is critical to the success of any business. And several justices nodded to the financial difficulties the USPS has faced over the years.
Groff, who lives in Pennsylvania, served in 2012 as a rural carrier associate at the United States Postal Service, a position that provides coverage for absent career employees who have earned the ability to take off weekends. Rural carrier associates are told they need flexibility.
In 2013, Groff’s life changed when the USPS contracted with Amazon to deliver packages on Sundays. Groff’s Christian religious beliefs bar him from working on Sundays.
The post office contemplated some accommodations to Groff such as offering to adjust his schedule so he could come to work after religious services, or telling him he should see if other workers could pick up his shifts. At some point, the postmaster himself did the deliveries because it was difficult to find employees willing to work on Sunday. Finally, the USPS suggested Groff choose a different day to observe the Sabbath.

The atmosphere with his co-workers was tense and Groff said he faced progressive discipline. In response, he filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is charged with enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against an employee because of religion.
Groff ultimately left in 2019. In a resignation letter, he said he had been unable to find an “accommodating employment atmosphere with the USPS that would honor his religious beliefs.”
Groff sued arguing that the USPS violated Title VII – a federal law that makes it unlawful to discriminate against an employee based on his religion. To make a claim under the law, an employee must show that he holds a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a job requirement, he must inform his employer and has to have been disciplined for failing to comply.
Under the law, the burden then shifts to the employer. The employer must show that they made a good faith effort to “reasonably accommodate” the employee’s belief or demonstrate that such an accommodation would cause an “undue hardship” upon the employer.
District Judge Jeffrey Schmehl, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, ruled against Groff , holding that that his request to not work on Sundays would cause an “undue hardship” for the USPS.
The 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling in a 2-1 opinion.
“Exempting Groff from working on Sundays caused more than a de minimis cost on USPS because it actually imposed on his coworkers, disrupted the workplace and workflow, and diminished employee morale,” the 3rd Circuit wrote in its opinion last year.
“The accommodation Groff sought (exemption from Sunday work)” the court added, “would cause an undue hardship on USPS.”
A dissenting judge, Thomas Hardiman, offered a road map for justices seeking to rule in favor of Groff. The main thrust of his dissent was that the law requires the USPS to show how the proposed accommodation would harm “business” – not Groff’s coworkers.
“Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stayed Gerald Groff from the completion of his appointed rounds,” wrote Hardiman, a George W. Bush nominee who was on a shortlist for the Supreme Court nomination that went to Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. “But his sincerely held religious belief precluded him from working on Sundays.”
Groff’s lawyer, Aaron Streett, told the high court that the USPS could have done more and was wrong to claim that “respecting Groff’s belief was too onerous.” He urged the justices to cut back or invalidate precedent and allow an accommodation that would allow the worker to “serve both his employer and his God.”
“Sunday’s a day where we get together and almost taste heaven,” Groff told The New York Times recently. “We come together as believers. We celebrate who we are, together. We worship God. And so to be asked to deliver Amazon parcels and give all that up, it’s just really kind of sad.”
The Biden administration has urged the high court to simply clarify the law to make clear that an employer is not required to accommodate an employee’s Sabbath observance by “operating shorthanded or regularly paying overtime to secure replacement workers.”
Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar acknowledged, however, that employer could still be required to bear other costs such as administrative expenses associated with rearranging schedules.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/25/africa/rwandan-genocide-suspect-south-africa-intl/index.html,Most wanted Rwandan genocide suspect arrested in South Africa after decades on the run,,,,CNN,"The most wanted fugitive in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 has been arrested in Paarl, South Africa after decades on the run.
Fulgence Kayishema is accused of orchestrating the killing of more than 2,000 Tutsi refugees – women, men, children and the elderly – at Nyange Catholic Church during the genocide . He has been on the run since 2001.
He was captured Wednesday in a joint operation between the South African authorities and UN investigators.
When he was arrested, Kayishema initially denied his identity, according to a statement from the UN team. But by the end of the evening he told them: “I have been waiting a long time to be arrested.”
Investigators said he used multiple identities and forged documents to evade detection.
“The arrest was the culmination of an intense, thorough and rigorous investigation,” a senior official at the prosecutor’s office involved in the case told CNN.
“Family members and known associates were exhaustively investigated. That ultimately led to identifying the right location to search and finding the critical intelligence that was needed.”
“Fulgence Kayishema was a fugitive for more than 20 years. His arrest ensures that he will finally face justice for his alleged crimes,” said Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz of the United Nations’ International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT).
“Genocide is the most serious crime known to humankind. The international community has committed to ensure that its perpetrators will be prosecuted and punished. This arrest is a tangible demonstration that this commitment does not fade and that justice will be done, no matter how long it takes,” Brammertz said.
At the end of the genocide in July 1994, Kayishema fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo with his wife, children and brother-in-law. After relocating to other African countries, he moved to South Africa in 1999 and claimed asylum in Cape Town, using a false name.
According to prosecutors, since his arrival in South Africa he was able to rely on a tight support network including former Rwandan military members which went to extreme lengths to conceal his activities and whereabouts.
In recent years, the IRMCT prosecutor has complained about the lack of cooperation from South African authorities and there have been a series of near misses capturing Kayishema. A report describes a failure to arrest Kayishema three years ago.
But on Thursday, Brammertz lauded the cooperation and support of the South African government.
The events in Nyanga, Rwanda, were one of the most brutal of the genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed over the period of 90 days.
The tribunal alleges that Kayishema directly participated in the “planning and execution of this massacre.” The indictment says he bought and distributed petrol to burn down the church while refugees were inside. Kayishema and others are also accused of using a bulldozer to collapse the church following the fire, while refugees were still inside.
The former priest at the church, Athanase Seromba, was convicted over the massacre in 2006 and sentenced to 15 years in prison, which was later increased to a life sentence on appeal.
Kayishema is due to be arraigned on Friday in a Cape Town court.
A reward of up to $5,000,000 was offered by the US War Crimes Rewards Program for information on Kayishema and the other fugitives wanted for perpetrating the Rwandan genocide.
With the arrest of Kayishema, the UN is still seeking three more prominent suspects.
In 2020, another fugitive was captured in a Paris suburb after more than 20 years on the run.
Félicien Kabuga , “one of the world’s most wanted fugitives,” who is alleged to have been a leading figure in the genocide, was arrested in a joint operation with French authorities.
The Rwandan genocide saw Hutu militias and civilians alike murder vast numbers of members of the Tutsi ethnic minority: men, women and children, many of whom had been their neighbors before the conflict began.
The killings finally came to an end 100 days later, when Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) troops, led by Paul Kagame, defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the country."

https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/21/africa/west-africa-benin-used-cars-climate-intl/index.html,"As the West surges toward electric cars, here’s where the unwanted gas guzzlers go",,,,CNN,"Standing on the stony ground in the bustling Fifa Park car lot, Rokeeb Yaya is haggling over the price of a dark red car. It is one of a couple hundred vehicles, parked in long lines stretching out across the vast lot – some shiny and new-looking, others dented and dusty.
The car Yaya has his eye on, a 2008 US-built Ford Escape, is on sale for around $4,000. It’s relatively affordable – US cars are cheaper than most other brands in the lot – and he wants to upgrade from his motorbike to a car. He is not interested in the history of the vehicle, he said, only that he can afford it.
But how this Ford ended up here – in one of the biggest car lots in the port city of Cotonou – helps tell a bigger story about how many of the West’s gas-guzzling cars are starting second lives in West Africa.
The 14-year old Ford arrived in Benin from the United States last year, after being sold at an auto auction.
Car records reviewed by CNN show it had three previous owners in Virginia and Maryland, and has logged over 252,000 miles on the road. It had one previous recall for its power steering, but unlike some of the other cars on the lot, it arrived in a relatively sound condition – it hadn’t been in any reported accidents.
This aging SUV is just one of millions of used cars that arrive every year in West Africa from wealthy countries such as Japan, South Korea, European countries and, increasingly, the US. Many of these end up in Benin, one of Africa’s top importers of used vehicles.
The stream of used cars heading to West African ports is only expected to increase with the West’s shift to electric vehicles. As wealthy countries set aggressive goals to move consumers towards electric vehicles to cut planet-warming pollution , gas-powered cars won’t necessarily go away.
Instead, many will be shipped thousands of miles away to developing countries like Benin, where populations are growing, along with demand for used cars.
Experts say the effect will be to divert climate and environmental problems to countries that are the most vulnerable to the climate crisis , undermining their own attempts to cut planet-warming pollution.
The global market for used light-duty vehicles grew nearly 20% from 2015 to 2019, when more than 4.8 million were exported. There was a slight dip in exports in 2020 when the Covid pandemic started, but numbers are now “growing quite rapidly,” United Nations Environment Programme official Rob de Jong told CNN.
The US exports about 18% of the world’s used vehicles, according to UNEP data. These travel all over the globe, including to the Middle East and Central America, but many go to Nigeria, Benin and Ghana.
Some of these are salvaged cars that have been in accidents, were flooded, or are just too old – which get auctioned off for parts. Others are whole used cars that US car dealers are looking to offload.
“A lot of them are going to be two- to five-year-old Hyundais, Toyotas, sedans,” said Dmitriy Shibarshin, marketing director for West Coast Shipping, a company that specializes in shipping cars internationally. “It’s mostly the economy cars that get shipped there.”
Shibarshin’s company and others are “like FedEx” for cars, he said. His company usually specializes in higher-end vehicles, but also ships cheaper cars.
In major African countries like Kenya and Nigeria, more than 90% of the cars and trucks are used vehicles from overseas. In Kenya, where de Jong is based, the vehicle fleet has doubled every eight years; streets that used to be devoid of cars are now jammed with traffic, he said.
There is a tremendous appetite for these used vehicles. “You have a very young population that’s getting richer and richer by the day,” said Etop Ipke, the CEO of Autochek Africa, an online marketplace for cars. “The first thing they want to do, as they can afford things, is some mobility,” he said.
But, unlike in the US , few prospective buyers have access to credit, so new cars are often out of reach.
“That is fundamentally the reason why we’re not able to improve the quality” of cars sold, Ipke said. “It’s not like people want to drive used cars; it’s an affordability issue.”
Experts say demand for used cars could explode further as the take up of electric cars in the West increases the supply of used cars to African countries. Nearly one in five vehicles sold globally this year will be electric, according to the International Energy Agency , compared to less than 5% in 2020. China, Europe and the US are leading the EV market, the agency said.

In states like New York and Florida, where consumers are buying more EVs, dealers are increasingly looking overseas as a place to sell their older gas-powered models, according to Matt Trapp, a regional vice president at the huge auto auction company Manheim.
Those states also have robust port operations, making them an ideal place to ship used cars to Africa. “It’s setting up a really complementary dynamic,” Trapp told CNN.
“I’m not surprised to see how robust the export game is becoming,” Trapp said. “We’re going to see this dynamic more and more. When [auto dealers] see demand in other markets, they will find a way to move the metal there.”
From UNEP’s perspective, not all gas-powered cars are concerning – it’s the older ones, which tend to pollute more and be less safe, De Jong said. There’s evidence that the increasing demand in Africa for vehicles is actually resulting in more old and salvaged cars being shipped to the continent recently than there were 20 years ago.
“What we see at the moment is a wide variety of used vehicles being exported from the global north to the global south,” de Jong said. “Not only is the number increasing, but the quality is decreasing.”
In one section of Fifa Park, CNN finds a 16-year-old Dodge Charger, worn by age.
“We just sold it for 3 million XOF [around $4,500],” its seller, who did not wish to be named, said of the vehicle that arrived in Benin from the US two years ago.
Parked across from the Charger is a 24-year-old Ford Winstar that was shipped to Benin from the US last year. It’s a cheaper alternative for low-income car buyers who cannot afford newer models.
Car dealer Abdul Koura said that US and Canadian cars are very desirable to importers, who often bring in cars that have been in accidents, he told CNN.
“They repair these cars and resell them to make a profit,” said Koura, whose space at Cotonou’s Fifa park includes more than 30 used vehicles imported from Canada.
Victor Ojoh, a Nigerian car dealer who frequents Fifa Park, told CNN that it’s often possible to tell the origin of a car by what’s wrong with it.
“The cars that smoke are mostly from the US,” said Ojoh. “The cars from Canada are mostly flooded cars that start developing electrical faults.”
Some imported vehicles are missing their catalytic converters, an exhaust emission control devices which filter toxic gasses. Catalytic converters contain valuable metals including platinum and can fetch up to $100 on the black market. Some of the cars are shipped without catalytic converters or have them removed by dealers upon arrival, Ojo said.
Millions of cars shipped to Africa and Asia from the US, Europe and Japan are “polluting or unsafe,” according to UNEP . “Often with faulty or missing components, they belch out toxic fumes, increasing air pollution and hindering efforts to fight climate change.”
Regulations aimed at reducing pollution and increasing the safety of imported cars into West Africa have tended to be weak. But attempts have been made recently to tighten them up.
In 2020, Benin and 14 other members of the Economic Community of West African States bloc agreed a set of vehicle emissions regulations in the region, including an age limit of 10 years for used vehicles and limits on the amount of carbon pollution cars are allowed to produce.
But it’s unclear how strictly they are being enforced.
UNEP officials, including de Jong, have also had conversations with US and EU officials about putting in new regulations that would crack down on shipping very old or junk cars to developing nations. Those conversations are in early stages and have yet to result in any commitments.
Still, de Jong said climate change and global emissions have made the conversation around used cars “a different ballgame.” Increased shipments of older and more polluting cars are just as much of a problem for developed nations as they are for the developing countries where they are being driven, he added.
“Today with climate change, it doesn’t really matter where the emissions are taking place,” de Jong said. “Whether in Washington, DC, or Lagos, it makes no difference.”
Ipke doesn’t think that it is inevitable that Africa will accept all the old gas-powered cars the West no longer wants. He hopes that the transition to electric vehicles will come to the African continent as well, although that will require significant improvements to the charging infrastructure.
“In terms of where Africa goes, the transition shouldn’t necessarily be from used cars to brand new combustion engines, it should be from used cars to EVs,” Ipke said. “I think the continent has to be prepared for EVs, used or brand new, because that’s the direction the world is taking.”
For Yaya, however, this all seems a long way off. What brought him to Fifa Park, and to the old Ford SUV, was a lack of other options.
“I can only purchase what my money can afford,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/22/africa/malawi-court-lifts-dreadlocks-ban-intl/index.html,Their son was banned from school for 3 years because of his dreadlocks,,,,CNN,"For years, Alli Nansolo grappled with whether to cut his son’s dreadlocks or not. Although it is not a legal requirement in Malawi, an unwritten policy enforced across government schools meant his son was being denied admission because of his hair.
Nansolo’s could not pay for private education for his son Ishmael from his modest dressmaking income and cutting his hair, an important symbol of their Rastafari religion, was inconceivable to him.
“Rastafari is a spiritual way of life. Keeping dreadlocks is like we are committing ourselves to a vow before the most high creator that we will serve him in our life without denying his laws or commandments,” Nansolo told CNN.
The 48-year-old makes between 200,000 to 300,000 Malawian Kwacha (around $194 to $291) monthly, while his wife Empress supplements the family’s income by selling secondhand clothes.

“I felt oppressed,” Nansolo said as he recalled the staff of a state-run secondary school in Zomba, southern Malawi. refusing to register Ishmael because of his hair.
Nansolo said he contacted an officer at the Ministry of Education who advised him to cut his son’s hair so that he could go to school.
Nansolo found himself caught up in the discriminatory policies of Malawian public schools and decided to take legal action against the Ministry of Education, along with a group of parents.
“I went to the Women Lawyers Association of Malawi to ask for help. The association accepted and we went to court in November 2017,” he said.
For three years, Ishmael, then 15, would remain out of school as the court case dragged on.
Then, in 2020, the Malawi High Court placed an interim order compelling public schools to enroll Ishmael and other Rastafari children until a final ruling was reached.
It was a legal victory that marked a significant milestone for the estimated 15,000 Rastafarian community in Malawi, according to Nansolo, who is also a community elder.
However, the temporary relief did not address the broader issue of discrimination that around 1,200 affected students face, their lawyer Chikondi Chijozi told CNN.
“We saw a number of Rastafari children being admitted into government schools but there were still reported cases of children of [the] Rastafari community being denied admission into government schools, and their parents were forced to take the court injunction to the school to compel them to admit them,”  Chijozi said.
After a six-year legal challenge, the Malawian High Court delivered a landmark ruling on May 8.
The court ruled that it was unlawful to require learners, including Rastafarian kids, to cut their hair before they are enrolled into public schools.
The ruling came into immediate effect but the government has until June 30 to issue a nationwide statement mandating acceptance of all dreadlocked children into school.
Chijoki told CNN: “We got a judgment from the court which essentially upheld the rights of the Rastafari children and abolished the policy that requires all learners, including Rastafari children, to cut off their dreadlocks for them to be admitted into government schools.”

Nansolo expressed his community’s jubilation that their children could now finally continue their education.
“The judgment means that we are now free because most of us in [the] Rastafarian community don’t earn much, so we couldn’t manage to send our children to private schools,”  Nansolo said.
“We are happy seeing that our children will now be going to public schools without being sent back or denied their right to education.”
CNN has contacted the education ministry for comment on the ruling.
Despite this victory, Malawi’s Rastafarian community still faces numerous challenges. Unemployment, poverty, and corporate discrimination persistently plague the community. Data on the community is hard to come by but the US State Department says around 5.6 percent of Malawi’s nearly 21 million population is formed of other religions including Hindus, Baha’is, Rastafarians, Jews, and Sikhs.
“Most of us rely on business to survive. Lack of jobs is a big challenge for the Rastafarian community because those in offices are reluctant to employ Rastas,” Nansolo said.
“The corporate world feels that being Rastafari is associated with criminality, but we are not like that.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/18/business/stephen-saad-aspen-pharmacare-spc-intl/index.html,Aspen Pharmacare CEO Stephen Saad on the future of medicine in Africa,,,,CNN,"When Africa needs medicines, all too often the continent must look abroad.
African nations consume about 25% of vaccines produced globally, but import nearly 99% of their supply, according to the African Union Development Agency. For packaged medicines, only 36% of demand is produced locally, and just 3% is supplied by regional trade, according to the World Economic Forum.
Of the roughly 600 manufacturers of packaged medicines operating on the continent, South Africa’s Aspen Pharmacare is one of the largest, with more than 9,000 employees in over 50 countries. CEO Stephen Saad discussed the future of the pharmaceutical sector in Africa, and what lessons Aspen Pharmacare has learned from the Covid-19 pandemic, with CNN’s Eleni Giokos.
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
During the pandemic, we’ve seen a spotlight on the inequalities that exist on the continent in the pharmaceutical sector. Aspen has had a very strong commercial presence across Africa and now you’re moving up the value chain. Certainly Covid has catalyzed a lot of work that you’re doing. Tell me what you’re up to.
Saad: You mentioned inequalities. [Covid] really sparked the world’s attention to say, ‘Hey, this doesn’t seem right.’ We were very proud to be able to deliver vaccines to the continent in the quantities that we did, but the reality of Covid was that Africa didn’t get vaccinated. But what we’ve learned — whether it was Aids or multi-drug-resistant TB — is that we have to be strong regionally. We have really doubled down and instead of saying, ‘Look we’ve lost the Covid vaccine volumes and so we’re closing up,’ we’ve actually put [in] even more capacity. We’re committed to one person one vaccine in Africa and we’re working very hard towards that process.
If I had to ask you to describe what the pharmaceutical sector looks like right now in Africa, what would your answer be?
The answer is simple. When Covid came and Africa needed vaccines, over 90% of the vaccines were supplied by India — and that wasn’t great. At the end of the day, you can’t ask politicians from other countries to supply someone else before them. I don’t think anybody wants Africans to suffer, but the reality is when the borders close, whether it was Europe or India, they looked after their own population first. If it hadn’t been for Aspen, there would have been no vaccines made in Africa for the continent.
There’s a lot of money going into it now, there’s a lot of investment, there are many initiatives — many of them government-driven. We, off our own bat, have decided that we want to be a source not just of vaccines but biologicals — we would really like to be assisting in oncology, diabetes. We’ve got a lot that we would like to do across the continent to make sure we get access, because there are so many diseases that are just so under-serviced.
The World Trade Organization has done a lot on the policy front for Africa. The Continental Free Trade Area will hopefully make it a lot easier for cross-border trade in the pharmaceutical space. What challenges do you face?
There are numerous challenges. We have facilities in Accra [Ghana], Dar-es-Salaam [Tanzania], Nairobi [Kenya] … It is not always easy to get registrations approved. You decide not to put medicine in Kenya, for example, because of the cost of registration and the time taken. Whereas if it was already registered, we’d be exporting manufacturing into one of those territories.
It’s not so much a tariff issue or a trade issue, this is really a regulatory issue, where your medicine is required to be registered in a specific country in a specific way. For example, you can register a product across Europe [via] a central regulatory body. I think that is something that Africa should also consider.
Even though you say you’re doing good, you still have to make money. How do you balance out all of these factors?
There is this [misconception] that for you to supply cost-affordably means that it’s not very profitable. So much is about economies of scale. I remember when we did ARVs [antiretrovirals, used to treat HIV] and we were desperately trying to cut the price by nearly 90%. We got some fantastic pricing from everyone, but we still made a loss. The decision we made was, let’s go for it. At worst we would have a pretty expensive social investment project, but we backed ourselves that with increased volumes we would be able to reduce pricing. That’s what happened — the volumes came in, the prices, the technologies, and it became affordable. So sometimes you just have to go in and do it. I can’t tell you it was an exact science, but I do believe there’s a balance to be had.
I do think the world acknowledges that there are people that can pay and there are people that can’t pay. To deny people that can’t pay simply because they don’t have money is not a model that’s sustainable."

Aid agencies and scientists have warned climate change is among the key factors accelerating humanitarian emergencies, while those impacted are some of the least responsible for CO2 emissions.
Seasonal rains in Somalia and upstream in the Ethiopian highlands triggered flash floods that washed away homes, crops, and livestock, and temporarily closed schools and hospitals in Beledweyne, the capital of Hiraan region, local residents said.
“At once the entire city was underwater. Beledweyne itself became like an ocean,” said shopkeeper Ahmed Nur, whose business was washed away.
“Only the roofs of the houses could be seen. We used small boats and tractors to rescue people,” he said.

Nur has been staying with relatives on the edge of the city which, just weeks earlier, had been celebrating the end of the crippling drought.
“Rain came, we were happy. People planted their crops,” he said.
The drought, coupled with violence and a spike in food prices caused by the war in Ukraine, killed as many as 43,000 people last year, according to United Nations figures.
Since mid-March the floods have affected more 460,000 nationwide and killed 22, according to the U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA).
The Somali Disaster Management Agency said the floods in Beledweyne alone have caused the displacement of more than 245,000 people.
“Recovery from six consecutive seasons of poor rainfall performance will take time,” OCHA said in a May 14 report.
The rains are recharging water sources and enabling vegetation to regenerate, however, it will take much more rainfall to effectively alleviate the impact of the recent drought, OCHA said in a report.
After back-to-back disasters, at least one resident of Beledweyne, Halima Abdullahi, said she had seen enough, making her one of the 216 million people the World Bank predicts could be compelled to move within their own country by 2050 because of climate stress.
“We shall move to villages far away,” said the mother of two children. “Beledweyne no longer exists.”"

Thirteen people were earlier rescued but 17 are still unaccounted for and on Monday, the body of a one-year-old toddler was pulled out of the river, which Zalakoma said was infested with crocodiles and hippos.
Those found dead were aged between 17 and 51, she added.
A lawmaker for the Nsanje district, Gladys Ganda , said the villagers were crossing the Shire River to get to their farms at the Malawian border with Mozambique when the boat they were traveling in was struck by the hippo.

This is “an unusually large number of lions to be killed at one go,” a spokesperson for the KWS told CNN on Sunday.
It comes after conservationists announced the killing of one of Africa’s oldest lions, Loonkiito, at the age of 19 earlier this week.

He had ventured out of a protected area and into a livestock pen due to being “starving,” and was killed by the livestock owner, according to conservation organization Lion Guardians.
The organization said that the end of a drought is commonly marked by an increase in human-lion conflict, since wild prey becomes harder to hunt and livestock owners are “particularly vigilant” after losing so many animals. Kenya has been experiencing its worst drought in 40 years .
The six lions that died on Saturday had killed 11 goats and one dog, the KWS said in a press release on Saturday.
The lions were all part of Kajiado County’s Amboseli ecosystem , a UNESCO biosphere reserve site near Mount Kilimanjaro, according to the UN .
KWS hosted a meeting Saturday attended by locals and government officials to discuss the recent killings.
“The discussions centered on exploring ways to minimize the risk of human-wildlife conflict, including developing early warning systems to alert communities to the presence of wildlife in their vicinity,” said the KWS.
“Further discussions centered on the wider picture of exploring human-wildlife conflict in the context of community livelihoods and benefit sharing towards a harmonious coexistence in the open community and wildlife landscapes,” it added."

“Among the things we noted was the docking of the cargo ship in Simon’s Town naval base between the 6th to the 8th of December 2022, which we are confident uploaded weapons and ammunition onto that vessel in Simon’s Town as it made its way back to Russian,” Ambassador Reuben Brigety II told local media, including News24.com.
“We are confident that weapons were loaded onto that vessel, and I would bet my life on the accuracy on that assertion,” the ambassador also said in a video released by Newzroom Afrika, a local news channel that was also at the briefing.
“The arming of the Russians is extremely serious, and we do not consider this issue to be resolved, and we would like SA to [begin] practicing its non-alignment policy,” he said, according to both news outlets.
In response to the ambassador’s claims, South Africa has summoned Brigety to Pretoria. In a statement released on Twitter Friday, Clayson Monyela, the head of public diplomacy for the South African foreign ministry, said it would “demarche the USA Ambassador to South Africa following his remarks yesterday.”
Monyela said a detailed statement would be released following the meeting. South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor would also speak to her US counterpart, Secretary Antony Blinken, about the matter, he added.
The presence of the mysterious ‘Lady R’ cargo vessel caused significant speculation when it docked at the naval base in Simon’s Town near Cape Town in December last year. Cargo vessels routinely dock at Cape Town’s civilian harbor, not the naval base.
At the time, opposition member of parliament and shadow Defense Minister Kobus Marais said in a statement that goods were loaded off and onto the ship during the overnight hours and demanded answers from the government.
The US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control added the Lady R to its sanctions list in May last year for alleged weapons shipments, along with a host of other Russian-flagged cargo vessels.
The South African presidency called the explosive allegations “disappointing” and warned that the remarks “undermine the spirit of cooperation and partnership” between the US and South African government officials who had been discussing the matter.

President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement late Thursday that no evidence had been provided to support these allegations and that the government planned to form an independent inquiry into the matter.
“In recent engagements between the South African delegation and US officials, the Lady R matter was discussed and there was agreement that an investigation will be allowed to run its course and that the US intelligence services will provide whatever evidence in their possession,” the statement read.
CNN asked presidential spokesman Vincent Magwenya why an inquiry was needed for events at South Africa’s own naval base.
“US intelligence services said they had evidence that they would only provide to us via a credible investigation or inquiry. We take the allegations seriously, and we want to have a credible independent voice to state the actual facts of the matter,” he said.
“Otherwise, we risk a back forth series of accusations and denials, which is not going to be helpful in the context of our bilateral relations.”
It is unusual for a US ambassador in South Africa to make such public accusations against the government.
The South African government has come under intense criticism for its stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has routinely abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations General Assembly.
While South African leadership has repeatedly stated that they are neutral in the conflict and have frequently called for a negotiated settlement, their actions have come under increasing scrutiny from Western powers.
In February of this year, South Africa convened naval war games off its coast including both the Russian and Chinese military.
Later this year, South Africa will host the BRICS summit, a grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to that summit.
South African officials have flip-flopped in their public commitment to the Rome Statute – the treaty that compels signatory nations to arrest individuals indicted by the court – after Putin was indicted for alleged war crimes in March.

The chef, known on social media as Hilda Baci, started cooking on Thursday and continued until Monday – creating more than 55 recipes and over 100 meals designed to showcase the best of Nigerian cuisine in the marathon kitchen session.
The Guinness world record committee still has to confirm that all their criteria have been met and whether Bassey will become the record holder.
The record to beat –  87 hours and 45 minutes – was set in 2019 by Indian chef Lata Tondon who posted a message of support to Bassey during her attempt.
Bassey told CNN that she was motivated to attempt the record because she wants to put Nigerian food on the map.
“Nigerian cuisine is the best out there,” she said. “The more recipes are propagated, the more people will be willing to try it. Nigerian food is such comfort food,” she added.
Despite the lack of sleep throughout her cooking spree in Lagos, Bassey remained in high spirits and could be spotted dancing and waving at her fans who turned out in droves to support her.
One man, Uduak Obong, told CNN he took a bus journey through the night, traveling hundreds of kilometers to arrive at the venue in Lagos.
“I drove 12 hours to be right here to support my sister, my friend. She’s just amazing,” he said.
Enioluwa Adeoluwa, a media personality, who also doubled as MC for the cookathon, told CNN: “When a Nigerian is doing something we all come out to show support… We are super excited. She’s doing such an amazing job.”
“She’s opening the door to the African food market and showing all the youth out here that if you can dream it, you can achieve it,” actor and Nollywood star Damilola Ogunsi said.
Celebrities including musician Tiwa Savage and local politicians visited Bassey during the cooking challenge.
Bassey told CNN that she nearly gave up on the first day, but after surpassing the previous record, she decided to aim for 100 hours.
“The first day was the most difficult. I was ready to give up 6 hours in. I feel like a miracle happened and somehow I got to this. The support has been incredible,” she said."

In 2006, their once-clear river water suddenly turned a vivid blue, tainted by waste from the copper mine owned by the Zambian subsidiary of UK-headquartered mining giant, Vedanta Resources, according to a 2015 Zambian Supreme Court ruling .
Villagers suffered nose bleeds, rashes, and abdominal pain, and some even had blood in their urine, which was a result of contamination by the Zambian subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM),  said Chilekwa Mumba, the son of a former miner who has been fighting for justice on behalf of the communities.
The Supreme Court ruling found that KCM was in contravention of its license and that the “final straw” was the bursting of slurry pipes which “discharged” acidic effluent into the tributaries of the Kafue River, which provides almost half of the country’s drinking water.
But attempts by residents to get compensation for damages caused to their environment  had been unsuccessful in Zambia.
In 2015, Mumba launched an epic David versus Goliath fight to try to secure compensation for the community.
The community organizer, led a six-year legal battle in the UK that eventually led to Vedanta Resources and its subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) paying compensation to 2,500 Zambian villagers, although the companies admitted no liability.
Along the way, Mumba helped to set a new precedent, allowing a British company to be sued for the actions of its subsidiary in another country.
On Monday, Mumba, 38, was awarded the 2023 Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa for his work for the community and setting legal precedent.                   ​
“It’s a wonderful feeling to receive this award,” he told CNN. “It’s the culmination of work which was done, not just by me but even the community themselves … who stood up against injustice and stood with us for six years.”
Mumba, a father of three, is one of six global winners of the prestigious award, which honors grassroots environmental activists.
The prize is awarded each year by The Goldman Environmental Foundation, with ceremonies in San Francisco and Washington, DC.
Zambia is Africa’s second-biggest copper producer and its economy relies heavily on copper mining, which generates more than half of its revenue from exports, according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
KCM is one of Zambia’s largest mining operations and also one of the country’s biggest private employers, according to its website.
CNN has reached out to Vedanta and KCM for comment but has not received a response.
Mumba said he faced a battle getting justice for Chingola communities suffering the effects of pollution.
In 2011, the Lusaka High Court ordered KCM to pay $2 million to 2,000 Chingola villagers for polluting Mushishima, a tributary of the Kafue River, with toxic chemicals.
The Environmental Council of Zambia, a body set up to protect the environment, provided evidence to the court that KCM violated its license by discharging acidic mine water waste into the river.
While the Supreme Court of Zambia later upheld the verdict that KCM polluted the villagers’ water source, it overturned the ruling on compensation, as the lower court had not fully assessed the extent of injury and damages for each of the 2,000 people.
Only six villagers had provided evidence to the high court of health complications, according to the Supreme Court ruling.

Determined to get justice for affected Chingola communities despite setbacks in the Zambian courts, Mumba approached English law firm Leigh Day in 2015 to launch a legal challenge against KCM’s parent company Vedanta in the UK.
No UK parent company had been held liable for environmental damages caused by their overseas operations at the time.
Vedanta Resources, founded by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, has had a controlling stake over KCM since 2004, with the Zambian government retaining minority control. CNN has contacted Vedanta and the Zambian state mining company for comments.
Mumba said he played the role of facilitator between community members and Leigh Day lawyers. He said he managed to convince the claimants to provide blood samples for analysis of the health impacts of the pollution, overcoming people’s concerns that their blood samples would be misused.
He recounted nearly being attacked by reptiles while wading through a flooded river during the rainy season to gather water quality samples for the case.
“It was just sheer will,” he told CNN. “The very first day we were collecting samples, we saw a snake just fall out of a tree. We laughed about it and moved on because we knew what we were trying to achieve. We also had to go close to a crocodile infested river, so there was always that threat.”
Mumba said he faced other challenges, including being arrested by local police in 2017 for not having the required permission from authorities to address thousands of villagers from polluted communities.
“I did feel threatened at certain times,” he said.
The road to compensation was lengthy.
A breakthrough came in 2019, when a landmark ruling from the UK Supreme Court held that the Zambians could sue Vedanta in the English courts, finding that Vedanta, as the parent company of KCM, owed the villagers a duty of care.
The ruling added that “even if Zambia would otherwise have been the proper place in which to bring the claims, there was a real risk that the claimants would not obtain substantial justice in the Zambian jurisdiction.”
The litigation was eventually settled. In January 2021, Vedanta announced in a joint statement with Leigh Day : “Without admission of liability, Vedanta Resources Limited and Konkola Copper Mines Plc confirm that they have agreed, for the benefit of local communities, the settlement of all claims brought against them by Zambian claimants represented by English law firm Leigh Day.”
A Leigh Day spokesperson, Caroline Ivison, told CNN that the amount paid as compensation was “confidential under the terms of the settlement agreement.”
Leigh Day attorney Oliver Holland, who worked on the Vedanta case, said in an email to CNN, that the 2019 UK Supreme Court ruling has established “an important precedent for providing access to justice for foreign claimants in transnational corporate liability litigation.”
Following the Vedanta case, the UK top court also ruled in the same year that two Nigerian communities could sue oil company Royal Dutch Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary in the English courts.
Peter Sinkamba, a prominent environmentalist in Zambia, said KCM’s now restricted operations due to a legal dispute over liquidation, have reduced pollution in the Copperbelt area. Zambian authorities handed control of the firm to a liquidator in 2019, sparking a legal dispute with Vedanta, the company’s largest shareholder.
Sinkamba, was among those who helped repeal a law preventing Zambian communities from suing mines for pollution in 1996, said the country’s judiciary is now building expertise in handling environmental cases. CNN has reached out to the office of the chief registrar of the Zambian judiciary​​​​.

Despite the risks posed to communities and wildlife in Zambia, mining operations are still being approved. The government, however, says that approved projects will follow environmental policies set by the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA).
Environmentalists were angered when Zambian authorities supported a huge open-pit mine for copper in Lower Zambezi National Park last year. Sinkamba says they fear that the project will harm the vital wildlife conservation area .
For Mumba, who now runs an orphanage in the Zambian capital Lusaka with his wife, the battle is far from over.
“I’m still working to make sure that our communities live in better ways in terms of the extractive industry. We want pollution and environmental degradation minimized if we cannot stop it,” he told CNN.
“We remain focused in holding those companies accountable … and the communities must be seen to get some justice.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/22/africa/reeddi-capsules-battery-nigeria-spc-intl/index.html,Batteries for hire could help Nigerians ditch their generators,,,,CNN,"Although Nigeria has vast energy reserves, more than 92 million people in the country live without access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Those who are connected to the electricity grid have to contend with frequent power cuts, which cost the country $28 billion a year – almost 2% of its GDP.
As a result, many Nigerians rely on petrol and diesel to fuel the generators that power their homes and businesses.
But generators are noisy, expensive, and pollute the air. Fuel shortages were a key issue in Nigeria’s recent presidential election and have made it increasingly difficult to run generators.
Entrepreneur Olugbenga Olubanjo is offering an alternative. His company Reeddi rents out small, lightweight solar-powered batteries called “Reeddi Capsules” that can power devices including TVs, laptops and refrigerators.
Reeddi was one of the finalists for Prince William’s Earthshot Prize , which recognizes ambitious efforts to fix environmental problems. In a podcast, the Prince of Wales said that “the capsule will have a huge influence on communities where energy poverty is a big deal.”
Olubanjo grew up in Nigeria and says that during his time studying engineering at the University of Ibadan, he often had to work on his assignments while contending with power cuts. As a postgraduate, he studied at the University of Toronto, in Canada. “For the first time in my life, I had access to electricity, and I saw my own productivity quadruple,” Olubanjo said.
Often, when calling family and friends back home, their power would go off, highlighting the energy inequality.  “As I had a deep understanding of the community, I felt obliged to do something,” he said.
Reeddi Capsules can be bought along with a solar panel for 199,000 Nigerian Naira (around $430) or rented from “mom-and-pop shops” for 24 hours for around 50 cents, charged using solar panels operated by Reeddi. Olubanjo says one battery can power a TV for around five hours, or a 15-watt fan for 15 hours.

That makes it considerably more expensive than using mains electricity, but it’s often cheaper than running a generator.
Joel Jewell, a trader in Ogun State, says he uses the capsule most days to charge his laptop and phone. Without it, he is forced to rely on his generator during the regular power cuts. “We sometimes don’t (even) get two hours of power supply,” he said. “And Reeddi coming is a kind of an answer to prayer.”
Currently, the batteries are only available in Nigeria, where Olubanjo says they are used by more than 1,600 people, mainly in Lagos and Ogun State. But across the continent, more than 600 million people lack access to electricity,  according to the International Energy Agency.
Olubanjo says organizations in countries including Uganda, Ghana and South Africa have expressed an interest in the Reeddi Capsule. “We’re going to try our best to optimize what we have in Nigeria before we scale it to that broader part of Africa,” he said.

Reeddi is not the only company offering battery packs as an alternative to generators. UK-based Mobile Power rents out batteries in countries including Nigeria, Zambia and Ghana.
Anita Otubu, a senior director of Sustainable Energy for All – a UN-affiliated organization that works to improve access to energy – says “companies like Reeddi are key contributors to reducing Nigeria’s access deficit.”
But she adds that if Reeddi is to scale up its business, it will need to make the battery rentals cheaper “or increase the capacity of each system, to enable Nigerians to have value for money when they purchase such systems.”
For Olubanjo, the company’s biggest challenge is keeping up with demand, with each batch of batteries taking three to four months to produce. But he is confident Reeddi can have a wider impact.
“The goal is to make the future (brighter) for a lot of Nigerians and Africans,” he said."

Founded in 1989 by ABBA manager Stig “Stikkan” Anderson, the Sweden-based Polar Music Prize has been awarded since 1992 and is considered to be among the most prestigious honors in the music industry. Past winners include Paul McCartney (1992), Elton John (1995), Stevie Wonder (1999), Björk (2010), and Sting (2017).
“Having a beautiful voice is one thing,” Kidjo told CNN’s African Voices in a 2018 interview . “You always have to think about what you want to do with that voice.”
She will join only two previous recipients from the African continent: South Africa’s Miriam Makeba in 2002, and Senegal’s Youssou N’Dour in 2013. Honored alongside Kidjo this year will be Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records in the UK, and Arvo Pärt of Estonia, the world’s most performed living composer, according to a Polar Music Prize press release.
“To be awarded the Polar Music Prize is humbling,” Kidjo says in the release. “I have no words to say how important this is for me. It comes with a sense of responsibility that is bestowed upon me as an artist to continue to do great work. I will do my best to be a proud recipient of the Prize through my work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, on behalf of the children, and as an ambassador of music, to help create a world in which we can all live in peace.”
The ceremony will take place on May 23 in Stockholm."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/africa/mercy-esther-tanzania-domestic-servitude-cfp-spc-intl/index.html,Finding a brighter future for Tanzania’s child domestic workers,,,,CNN,"Mercy Esther was eight years old when she left home.
Raised by her grandmother in rural Tanzania, Mercy Esther and her siblings were born into poverty, sometimes without money for food, let alone schoolbooks. When their grandmother was approached with a job offer for Mercy Esther in Kenya, and the promise that money would be sent home, she accepted. The money could help Mercy Esther’s siblings. They might have a better future.
The job offer turned out to be a lie – the first of a string of broken promises that would deprive a young woman of her childhood and her family.
Mercy Esther was born with a deformity in one foot, causing a pronounced limp. On the streets of Nairobi she and other children were forced to beg. She was told to pretend she could not walk, to elicit sympathy from the public. Each day, what money she collected was taken from her.
One day, while begging, Mercy Esther was approached by a woman who offered her domestic work and more promises: a new home, a wage and good treatment. She went with the woman, but instead Mercy Esther was abused and received no money for her labor. It would be six years before she ran away.
More from the CNN Freedom Project
With the support of the Nairobi police and Kenyan and Tanzanian governments, Mercy Esther returned to the country of her birth, but without details of the village where she was raised, authorities put her in the care of WoteSawa Domestic Workers Organization, which runs a shelter for trafficked children in Mwanza, on the shores of Lake Victoria, in the north of the country.
“Tanzania is a beautiful and a peaceful country, but there is a dark side,” said Angela Benedicto, the organization’s founder and executive director.
“Many people live in poverty, and forced labor is a very big problem,” she added. “The most common form of human trafficking in Tanzania is domestic servitude, young girls forced into domestic work. They face abuse, exploitation, and are not paid for their work.”
Around one million children – mostly girls – are engaged in domestic work in Tanzania, according to the non-profit Anti-Slavery International.
WoteSawa was set up in 2014 and every year takes in around 75 children who have escaped trafficking. Space is tight: children sleep two to a bed. Some stay longer than others, says Benedicto, particularly those involved in criminal cases, as prosecutions can take time. So far, the non-profit has helped hundreds of survivors, but the needs are greater than the resources available. Benedicto dreams of building a bigger haven for more children.
Her mission is to empower domestic workers and advocate for their rights. It’s an issue that’s close to her heart; she is herself a former domestic worker. “I faced abuse and exploitation, but I was able to speak out,” she explains. “Many domestic workers, they can’t speak out. Who is going to speak (for) them?”
“I’m using my story to tell them, ‘Don’t give up.’”
WoteSawa means “all are equal” in Swahili. At the shelter children are housed and provided with counseling and legal support. They also receive an education in literacy and numeracy, and vocational skills such as needlework. Reintegrating children back into education works in step with efforts to reunite children with their loved ones, “so that when they go back to their families, they can help not only themselves, but they can help their families,” said Benedicto.
Lydia lives in the Ngara district in the mountains of Western Tanzania. She left home to become a domestic worker aged 16, but was beaten by her employer and not paid for her work. She escaped and was helped by WoteSawa, where she learned how to sew. Lydia returned to her family with a sewing machine provided by WoteSawa and today she is a dressmaker with dreams of a shop of her own.

“She is making enough money to provide for her family,” said Benedicto. “Her dream is to help other young girls to know how to sew. She has a plan to give back to the community.”
As well as helping survivors of trafficking, WoteSawa works to prevent it from happening. Benedicto coordinates with bus depot agents on the lookout for young children, and with local police who have powers to intervene.
“My mission is to make sure (the) offense of human trafficking is stopped – totally. And it is through education we can achieve (that),” said police commander Juma Jumane. “We have to educate families. We have to educate the victim, him or herself. We have to educate also society in general.”
When Mercy Ester arrived at the shelter she was reluctant to share the name of her village because she feared being trafficked again if she returned there. But eventually she changed her mind.
CNN met Mercy Esther through the Poland-based Kulczyk Foundation, which supports WoteSawa.
WoteSawa was able to find her family, and took her grandmother and siblings to the shelter. It had been eight years since they had last seen each other. “It was so emotional,” said Benedicto. “They cried, they hugged. I think every one of us was so emotional. We were in tears of joy.”
Mercy Esther is still uncomfortable with the idea of returning to her village and has chosen to stay at the shelter until she is older, and skilled enough as a seamstress to start a business to help provide for her family.
“Her future is so bright,” said Benedicto. “I can see that she will be a light to her siblings.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/sport/african-players-nba-basketball-africa-league-spt-spc-intl/index.html,Africa’s basketball stars are making their mark on the NBA,,,,CNN,"March 11 marked the start of the Basketball Africa League, the continent’s premier basketball competition. Ahead of its third season, president Amadou Gallo Fall reflected on the rise of the sport on the continent. “It’s been an evolutive journey,” he said.
This year’s competition will be held over three months, starting in Senegal’s capital, and Fall’s hometown, Dakar, and will feature 12 teams from across Africa
Launched in 2019 as a partnership between the NBA and the International Basketball Federation, the inaugural BAL season was postponed as a result of the Covid pandemic, finally taking place in 2021. It was the culmination of the work Fall has been doing for almost a quarter century. Read: ‘This is a dream’: Burna Boy, Afrobeats stars take center stage at the NBA All-Star game
In 1998, while studying in the US on a basketball scholarship, Fall founded the SEED Project (Sports for Education and Economic Development) – a non-profit that uses basketball as a platform to engage youth in academic, athletic and leadership programs. He was later involved in the NBA’s Basketball Without Borders program, which develops players from outside the US, and the opening of the NBA Africa office in 2010.
“All the programs that we’ve launched … are the milestones that ultimately led to the Basketball Africa League,” Fall said.
Those initiatives are helping to introduce more young Africans to the sport, and giving them an opportunity to pursue a basketball career on the continent.
“The best will always, hopefully, get to the NBA and that’s what we want. But if they don’t make it to the NBA, we want to make sure their next best choice is right here,” Fall adds.
At the start of the 2022-2023 season, NBA rosters included 16 players born in Africa, while 35 players had at least one African parent.
When the Toronto Raptors faced the Philadelphia 76ers last October, it was the first time an NBA court had been shared by three players from Cameroon: Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam and Christian Koloko, who have all taken part in the Basketball Without Borders camp.
It was a historic moment for African basketball and for Koloko, the Raptors rookie center.
“It was one of my first games in the NBA,” he recalled. “I was like wow; we really have three Cameroonians at the same time. Embiid was one of my favorite players (growing up),” he says.
That admiration is shared by others. Embiid was voted the third most likely player to win the MVP award this year, as part of an NBA survey of the league’s general managers.

Raptors president Masai Ujiri was raised in Nigeria and in 2010 became the first African general manager in US professional sports when he joined the Denver Nuggets. He joined the Raptors in 2013 and won the NBA championship with them in 2019. The team’s current roster features eight Africans – more than any team in the NBA.
Ujiri believes that, as the only NBA team based outside the US, it has a unique opportunity. “I think Toronto is global. We’re a team of the world,” he says.
Nonetheless, he is working to grow the game in his home continent. His Giants of Africa non-profit has hosted basketball camps for more than 5,000 children in 16 African countries since 2003 – and he is currently on a mission to build 100 basketball courts across the continent .
It ties in with efforts in the NBA and BAL to create an ecosystem to foster talent at in Africa. The rosters for this season’s 12 BAL teams will include 12 players from the NBA Academy Africa, an elite basketball training center in Saly, Senegal,
Raptors Cameroonian forward Siakam believes the future is bright for African talent. “We all know that this is something incredible that we are achieving,” he says. “At the end of the day Africa is winning.”

https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/03/sport/slasa-mambud-samai-sierra-leone-amputee-football-spc-spt-intl/index.html,SLASA: Amputee football association brings together Sierra Leone’s civil war survivors,,,,CNN,"On a busy weekend in Freetown, Sierra Leone, dozens of people gather to watch an afternoon football match not unlike countless others you’d find anywhere else in the world. But there’s one striking difference – these players are all amputees.
They’re members of the Single Leg Amputee Sports Association (SLASA), an organization co-founded by pastor Mambud Samai in 2001 after he returned home toward the end of Sierra Leone’s deadly civil war, which lasted from 1991 to 2002 and killed at least 50,000 people across the country. Thousands more were left with missing limbs during a brutal campaign to terrify the civilian population.
After coming across a refugee camp filled with hundreds of amputees, Samai felt compelled to help. “At that time, there were no activities like trauma recovery for them. So, amputees believed that once they lost their limbs and their legs, they have no future, they have no opportunity. So, I volunteered myself to give them confidence,” he said.
While at the refugee camp, he met an American missionary who introduced him to a form of adaptive football. After showing the amputees how to play, the response was overwhelming and SLASA was formed, “to give hope to the amputees, to give confidence to the amputees, and to allow them to become ambassadors of peace,” Samai said.
According to the World Amputee Football Federation , players cannot use prosthetics and instead power across the field on crutches. Each team has seven players on the field at a time, with outfield players only having one leg and goalkeepers only having one arm.
Several SLASA players have since gone on to compete in international programs including the World Amputee Football Championships, Amputee Africa Cup of Nations, and the Open European Amputee Football Championship.

“Most of them are now very proud that they can represent their country at international competitions,” Samai said. “They are contributing something back to society.”
Samai says the sport is not only a good form of exercise, but it unites players and serves as a “therapy” for war victims to face their shared trauma. “We try to give them hope and then give them the credibility that they are useful, they are important to society,” he said.
Ali Badara Kamara is a goalkeeper in the SLASA league. He says he’s grateful for the life-changing opportunities he’s received. “My mother was afraid (for) me to play football because she sees me as an amputee. She thought that if I fell on the floor, I would have another problem,” he says. “But SLASA (has) taken me to Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania.”
Kamara is one of the more than 80 million people with disabilities living across the continent. According to the United Nations, that figure includes those with mental health conditions, birth defects and other physical impairments. With assistive devices often unavailable or unaffordable, many find employment hard to come by and are left begging on the streets.
While football matches only last 90 minutes, Samai’s latest mission is to find a way to help amputees beyond the pitch.
“My passion (is) to make sure that every life, irrespective of your disability or irrespective of your background, that you are able to be happy and you are able to smile at the end of the day,” Samai said.
To achieve that, SLASA works closely with the National Rehabilitation Center in Sierra Leone and partners with international organizations like SwissLimbs to provide prosthetics for amputees and train local technicians.
In 2018, Samai traveled to Japan to study sustainable agriculture leadership and community development. Upon his return, he began offering classes on sustainable agriculture through SLASA.

SLASA also assesses members’ education and provides learning resources to those in need. Its goal is to get more amputees off the streets and provide them with a safe way to make a living for themselves and their families.
To date, Samai says SLASA has directly assisted 350 amputees, and hopes to grow that number. The ultimate goal is to build a regulation pitch and rehabilitation center of its own.
“We want Sierra Leone to compete with another countries in terms of development,” Samai said. “We believe that disabled people should not be left behind.”

https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/entertainment/grammys-consider-afrobeats-category-cec/index.html,The Grammys consider adding an Afrobeats category,,,,CNN,"Afrobeats – the pulsating, fusion sound coming out of West Africa and the diaspora – has been on the rise globally for the better part of a decade. In recent years, the genre has gained a foothold in Western pop culture, and the Grammys are taking notice.
Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. recently said that the Grammys were considering adding an award category for Afrobeats. Speaking to reporters in Ghana over the weekend, Mason said he had been meeting with players in the genre to explore the possibility.
“We called in producers, songwriters, artists, executives and we had a virtual listening session where we heard from Afrobeats creators,” he said at a September 24 news conference . “[We] just talked about, ‘What are the different subgenres? What are the needs? What are the desires?’”
Related video How Afrobeats has become an unstoppable musical force
It would likely take a while for such a change to be made, though. Throughout the year, the Recording Academy – the group of music industry professionals that presents the Grammy Awards – accepts proposals for new categories from its members. Those proposals are then reviewed by a committee and voted on by the Recording Academy Board of Trustees.
For example, at an April 2021 meeting, the Recording Academy approved the addition of two new categories in the global and Latin music fields, but the change didn’t take effect the 2022 Grammys. This year, the Recording Academy announced five additional categories, including songwriter of the year and best score soundtrack for video games and other interactive media, which will take effect at the 2023 Grammys.
“My goal is to make sure that we represent all genres of music, including Afrobeats, at the Grammys. But it has to be done properly,” Mason said during the news conference. “I think the listening session last week was very important, very valuable, and a step towards that path.”
Afrobeats artists have crossed over into mainstream pop through collaborations with Beyoncé, Drake, Ed Sheeran and other stars. But they’ve also achieved mainstream success on their own. Burna Boy, Wizkid and Tems have each notched Grammy nominations (though they’ve typically been relegated to the global music field), while Burna Boy garnered a win in 2021 for his album “Twice as Tall.” CKay’s “Love Nwantiti” dominated on TikTok last year before eventually showing up on the Billboard charts .
The UK’s Official Charts Company launched an Afrobeats singles chart in 2020 , while Billboard debuted a US-based Afrobeats chart this year, further nodding to the genre’s growth outside of Africa and the diaspora.

Flanked usually by his wife Eno, and an associate , Eze’s passionate prayers are delivered in an urgent staccato, as he prays for cures to ailments and challenges such as illnesses, court cases, and financial issues.
Eze touts miracle healings with the slogan ‘What God cannot do does not exist,’ and midway through the live broadcast, cuts to pre-recorded videos from his followers sharing testimonies they say are the results of his prayers.
They range from healings from terminal illnesses to conception after years of infertility.
Eze describes the testimonies as the “strange acts of God.”
“It’s way beyond science and technology,” he says.
CNN has not independently verified the content of the videos.
The broadcasts on the New Season Prophetic Prayers and Declarations channel (NSPPD) have propelled Eze to become one of the most watched preachers on YouTube.
With more than 90,000 peak concurrent viewers, Eze’s daily broadcasts rank among the most streamed globally on YouTube, according to the analytics website Playboard , which collates data for YouTube channels.
His YouTube platform also ranks second among gospel channels with the most live viewers worldwide – trailing behind Brazilian preacher Bruno Leonardo, Playboard’s data shows.

Eze also rakes in large amounts of donations from his broadcasts. He is one of YouTube’s top-earning preachers who are leveraging the platform’s Super Chat donations that help creators earn revenue.
YouTube’s Super Chat feature allows viewers to pin their comments on live streams for a fee that ranges from $1 to $500.
Eze’s YouTube channel receives one of the highest Super Chat donations in the world, according to Playboard .
Among his ardent fans is award-winning Nigerian singer D’banj who tells CNN joining Eze’s morning prayers has become a routine.
“Waking up every day to NSPPD … has become part of my daily routine. I hardly miss it. It’s part of my family’s morning devotion,” adds D’banj, whose real name is Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo.
The singer says he has had his own share of miracles from prayers on the platform.
“I remember last year Pastor Jerry said we should write seven things we want to see happen, and we prayed and I believed. I checked the list the other day and … all seven have been answered.”
Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh says she also connected with Eze’s ministry early last year. She’s now “addicted,” she tells CNN.
Eze, who turns 40 on Monday, has come a long way from the days he and his single-parent mother struggled to find food to eat.
“I came from a family where poor people will describe my family as poor,” he says. “There were days my mum and I had no food to eat, and my mum would hold my hand and pray and give thanks to God. My mum was a single parent and a petty trader who sold groundnuts in the market … There were days she’d come home crying having not made any sales, so unable to buy us what to eat.”
Born on August 22, 1982, in Bende Local Government Area of Abia state, Eze tells CNN his education was funded by a benevolent couple who had noticed his active engagement in a church in his early years.
“I was just doing things in church like sweeping, singing, and reading the Bible – doing what most of my mates did not want to do. I had just finished junior secondary school at the time before they took me in,” he says of the couple.
Eze excelled in his studies and obtained a degree in history and international relations from Abia State University. He also went on to complete a master’s in human resource management.
Before venturing into ministry, Eze previously worked with a local TV station before joining the World Bank project for HIV/AIDS and later worked as a communications specialist with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
“I was very excited about the job (at the UNFPA), but my mum wasn’t. She said it wasn’t what God told her. According to her, God told her I was going to be a preacher,” says Eze.
“I never shared those aspirations (to be a preacher). I wasn’t even listening to her. She and I lived in poverty, so I always asked why God didn’t first help us out of poverty before asking me to quit a job that was giving us money to be a preacher. The money I was giving her was coming out of the job (with the UN), so it didn’t make sense.”
He eventually quit his job and entered full-time ministry but sadly his mother died of heart failure before he fulfilled her ambition for him, he says.
“It was when she died that the reality of my assignment began to dawn on me,” he adds.
Entering into full-time ministry has come with huge sacrifices and Eze says he spends long hours praying into the night to prepare.
“I don’t have friends, I don’t hang out, I don’t have spare time. I can’t tell what my hobbies are anymore because there’s no room for hobbies,” he says.
Eze has two children with his wife Eno, who is also a pastor. He said his marriage hasn’t been perfect due to the demands of ministry.
“It hasn’t been 100 percent, but because my wife and I do the same thing (ministry), we bond the same way. The things that matter to other people don’t matter in our family. Our conversations are about ministry and how next we’ll fulfill God’s will for our lives. If I had married the wrong woman, I’ll be boring the person.”
Eze may have become an internet phenomenon, but insists his fame is accidental.
He had started livestreaming hoping to inspire his congregation when the pandemic shut down all church services and attendance at his fledgling ministry, Streams of Joy International, dwindled.
“It wasn’t a goal to reach the world,” Eze says. “During the (peak of) Covid, there was a palpable fear everywhere and I noticed that a lot of my church people were very scared of coming around the church. So, every morning, my wife and I will come online, spreading encouragement to people,” he tells CNN.
“I just wanted to speak hope,” he adds.
Eze’s daily messages of encouragement later morphed into a daily online prayer network every weekday on YouTube and other video-sharing services.
The live streams proved a hit and now in its third year, Eze’s YouTube channel has 880,000 subscribers as of this publication, and his broadcasts have garnered more than 122 million views over a three-year period, according to figures from his channel.
Viewers from the UK and the US jointly make up 25% of his live streams on YouTube, with more than one million views from the UK and over 700,000 views from the US between July 20 and August 16, 2022, according to figures from the platform.
Nigeria has the highest with over two million viewers. His broadcasts are also viewed in other African nations and countries such as Italy, Germany, Canada, France, Spain, Ireland, and the Netherlands, the chart showed.
Digital analyst Edward Israel-Ayide tells CNN Eze’s success can be linked to the “recent boom in digital churches and online religious movements.”
Israel-Ayide says this is because of the fallout from Covid-19.
“With lockdown restrictions in place, the need for community and a sense of belonging drove Nigerians at home and abroad to seek digital platforms that could provide them with direction and hope,” he says. “Post-Covid, many people are still seeking purpose and direction due to the socioeconomic challenges brought on by Covid-19 and the ongoing global economic crisis. This is one of the main reasons why religious movements like Pastor Jerry Eze’s NSPPD thrive.”
While many people now know him because of his online platform, “that’s not where it began,” Eze says. “There was a physical church before the online one.”
Eze founded the Streams of Joy International church in the suburbs of Nigeria’s eastern city of Umuahia many years before he shot to prominence.
Eze is now based in the Nigerian capital Abuja and his church has expanded beyond Nigeria to include branches in the UK, US and Canada.
Attendance in his Abuja church has also risen. But it is with the online community he has gained the most traction, and it is here to stay.
“People all over the world are accustomed to waking up and finding Pastor Jerry online,” Eze says. “It’s like a virus that has come stay.”"

I was still living in a house that was flooding,” said Cheboi, now 29. “Looking at the poverty in the household, looking at the community and suffering, it just became so clear that I needed to do something.”
Cheboi attended college on scholarship in the United States, worked odd jobs to support her family, and discovered her passion for computer science. She credits computer literacy for her ability to find job opportunities and make money doing what she loves. She knew she wanted to share it with her community back home.
Today, she’s giving 4,000 kids the chance for a brighter future through her nonprofit, TechLit Africa. The organization, whose name is short for Technologically Literate Africa, uses recycled computers to create technology labs in schools in rural Kenya.
“I know the pain of poverty, and that’s why I feel so passionate about it,” said Cheboi, a software engineer who splits her time between the US and Kenya. “I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.”
In 2012, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois and began her studies with almost no computer experience. She handwrote papers and struggled to transcribe them on a laptop. She said she never felt comfortable using a computer until her junior year when she took a Java course required for her mathematics major.
“When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,” she said.
Cheboi switched to a double major and earned a bachelor’s degree. Yet she says skills like touch-typing that came seamlessly to some were still a steep learning curve for her. At one point after college, she had to practice for six months before she could pass a coding interview. It’s a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.
“I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,” she said.
Cheboi made inroads with businesses in her profession, and in 2018 she began accepting recycled computers from them. She started small, carrying the machines to Kenya in check-on bags and handling customs fees and taxes herself.
“At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,” she said.
TechLit Africa now works with freight and shipping companies to transport the donated computers so it’s more cost efficient. The donated hardware is wiped, refurbished and distributed to partner schools in rural Kenya, where students aged 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals and gain skills that will help improve their education and prepare them for future jobs.
“We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,” Cheboi said. “They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production with our artists.”
Cheboi’s organization maintains online and onsite ownership of the computers, providing tech support, software updates and troubleshooting. TechLit Africa installs new customer operating systems geared towards children, and schools are asked to pay a small fee for the services, which includes TechLit educators onsite from 8am-4pm.
The organization currently serves 10 schools, and by early next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.
“My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they’re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they know how to do marketing,” Cheboi said. “The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.”

""We only have a few lights working and rely on generators, which are expensive to feed,"" said Dr. Petit-Frere Arabella, the resident maternity doctor at the Justinien University Hospital. ""We also have no running water, as the main hospital pump is down.""
The hospital staff, like many in Haiti right now, are doing the best they can with what little they have. The Caribbean nation, struggling with an epidemic of deadly gang violence and political instability, is facing a humanitarian crisis. Supplies are scarce as little is getting into the country .
""The airport, port and roads are all closed,"" Jacob Burns, operations manager for Médecins Sans Frontières, told Clarke. ""We have had no significant medical supplies delivered in weeks.""
Food has also been tough to come by, although the World Food Programme has been trying to fill in the gaps. But its supplies are dwindling, too, and there have been shortfalls in donor funding for the UN's Humanitarian Response Plan.
Clarke was able to return to the capital of Port-au-Prince earlier this month via a World Food Programme helicopter. In addition to visiting some of the few functioning medical facilities, he also photographed chaotic displacement sites and dilapidated schools that are occupied by people who have fled gang violence.
""The city I knew and have visited for the past 14 years is now a full-blown war zone in many areas,"" he said. ""Streets where we drove 12 weeks ago are now empty and under gang control — 'no go zones.' The General Hospital where I had met doctors, nurses and patients in February was no longer in operation and is now occupied by a gang and being used as a forward staging post for attacks against the nearby National Palace.""
Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned last month , handing power over to a transitional council. Haiti now awaits the deployment of a multinational security support force, led by Kenya.
""Contractors are furiously building temporary shelters for them near the airport, but they are likely to be only a few hundred in number,"" Clarke said. ""The gang leaders, meanwhile, have pledged to fight until the very last man to drive them out."""

American Lindsay Shiver, accused of conspiring to kill her husband with two co-defendants in the Bahamas, was granted bail of $100,000 by a Bahamian Supreme Court justice on Wednesday.
She will be outfitted with an electronic monitoring device and must comply with an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. As Shiver walked into court wearing ripped jeans and a T-shirt, spectators yelled questions but it did not appear she replied to anyone.

Shiver must report to the Cable Beach Police Station in Nassau three times per week. She must also not come within 100 feet of her husband, as part of her bail conditions.
When Bahamian Supreme Court Justice Cheryl Grant-Thompson finished laying out the conditions of Shiver’s bail, Shiver responded with a soft “OK.” After Shiver picks up her electronic monitoring device, she will be allowed to go to her new residence without returning to jail, her attorney Ian Cargill told CNN on Wednesday.
Shiver’s alleged co-conspirators, Terrance Adrian Bethel, 28, and Farron Newbold Jr., 29, had previously been released on $20,000 bail, Cargill told CNN on Friday.
Shiver, 36, of Thomasville, Georgia, is accused of unsuccessfully conspiring with the two Bahamas natives to kill her husband, Robert Shiver, on July 16 while on the Abaco Islands, months after the couple filed for divorce.
Police in the Bahamas successfully foiled the plot by acting on information found on a phone recovered during a separate criminal inquiry into a recent break-in at a local business, a Bahamian police source told CNN.
The defendants were arraigned last month, according to court documents. They were not required to enter pleas at that hearing.
Lindsay and Robert Shiver had filed for divorce in April, court records indicate.
Robert Shiver filed for divorce on April 5, and Lindsay Shiver filed for divorce the following day, according to the complaint listed on the Thomas County, Georgia, Clerk of Courts website.
Robert Shiver lists Lindsay’s “adulterous conduct” as a reason for divorce, saying the marriage is irrevocably broken, according to the filings viewed by CNN. The filing from Lindsay Shiver says she has “incurred debt beyond her means to pay,” and asks that her husband be made to pay.
Robert Shiver is an insurance executive and former Auburn University football player, court records and his company’s website show. Lindsay Shiver also attended Auburn University, according to social media posts.
Lindsay Shiver’s next court appearance is slated for October 5.
CNN has reached out to attorneys representing each of them in the divorce case.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/americas/argentina-vote-president-intl-latam/index.html,"Argentina election: Polls close, battle heading to run-off with Massa leading Milei",,,,CNN,"The battle to decide who will run crisis-wracked Argentina is heading to a run off vote next month between left wing candidate Sergio Massa and far right libertarian Javier Milei, according to data released by Argentina’s National Electoral Chamber after the first round of voting on Sunday.
After polls closed Massa received the highest number of votes – 8,877,325, accounting for 36.33% of the total, data revealed. Milei received 7,373,876 votes – roughly 30.18%.
Third place candidate Patricia Bullrich got 23.82% and conceded defeat late Sunday night.
Each is vying for the nation’s trust at a moment of widespread disillusionment with the country’s elite and its management of the country.
The results have highlighted a strong showing for the government coalition supporting Massa, who is currently Economic Minister  as Argentina finds itself in the most serious financial crisis of the last twenty years.
Turnout was over 75%, with more than 25 million Argentinians casting their ballots and over 90% of votes had been counted, the election body said.
“It has been a model day of Argentine democracy,” Julio Vitobello, general secretary of the presidency, said at a presser on Sunday night.

Inflation in Argentina has soared to 138%, Reuters reports, piling pressure on ordinary people trying to manage the cost of living.
“It’s so hard. Each day things costs a little more, it’s like always racing against the clock, searching and searching,” Laura Celiz told the news agency last month, she shopped on the outskirts of capital Buenos Aires. “You buy whatever is cheaper in one place and go to the next place and buy something else.”
After casting his vote in Buenos Aires on Sunday, current president Alberto Fernández celebrated the nation’s democracy on the social media platform X.
“I call on every Argentine to defend it and decide the future of the country at the polls,” he wrote.
Bullrich, a former security minister , told has CNN en Español that she would let economists run the finance ministry and offer a firm, calm hand at the wheel compared with Milei’s outbursts.
Boasting lengthy experience in national politics, she recently has worked to refresh her image to appeal to younger voters, uploading viral challenges to YouTube and making reference in interviews to her relationship with her cousin, singer Fabiana Cantilo.
Massa, who is in the current government , balances a heavy ministerial portolio including inflation control, soybeans (the country’s main export) and Argnetina’s relationship with the International Monetary Fund.
He has been trying to position himself as a more pragmatic voice from the left, compared to the current government coalition, and has worked to distance himself politically from Argentina’s high-profile vice-president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner – without alienating her power base.
Unlike his main rivals, political upstart Milei offers little governmental experience and promises to upend Argentina’s existing economic structures. For his supporters, Milei’s promises of overhaul have been seductive.
Milei , a former financial analyst and self-described “anarcho-capitalist” who wields a chainsaw at rallies, has suggested a raft of radical changes: dollarizing Argentina, slashing public subsidies and eliminating the ministries of culture; education; environment; and women, gender, and diversity.
To win in the first round of voting, a presidential candidate must obtain more than 45% of all votes or a minimum of 40% and at least a 10-point lead over the second-place candidate.
Argentina’s next president will take office in December and will begin a 4-year term."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/americas/amazon-river-lowest-levels-drought-climate-intl/index.html,Amazon River falls to lowest level in 121 years amid a severe drought,,,,CNN,"Rivers in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil fell to their lowest levels in over a century on Monday as a record drought upends the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and damages the jungle ecosystem.
The port of Manaus, the region’s most populous city, at the meeting of the Rio Negro and the Amazon River, recorded 13.59 meters (44.6 feet) of water on Monday, compared to 17.60 a year ago, according to its website. That is the lowest level since records began in 121 years ago in 1902, passing a previous all-time low set in 2010.
Rapidly drying tributaries to the mighty Amazon have left boats stranded , cutting off food and water supplies to remote villages, while high water temperatures are suspected of killing more than 100 endangered river dolphins .
After months without rain , rainforest villager Pedro Mendonca was relieved when a Brazilian NGO delivered supplies to his riverside community near Manaus late last week.
“We have gone three months without rain here in our community,” said Mendonca, who lives in Santa Helena do Ingles, west of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state. “It is much hotter than past droughts.”
Some areas of the Amazon have seen the least rain from July to September since 1980, according to the Brazilian government disaster alert center, Cemaden.
Brazil’s Science Ministry blames the drought on the onset of the El Niño climate phenomenon this year, which is driving extreme weather patterns globally. In a statement earlier this month, the ministry said it expects the drought will last until at least December, when El Niño’s effects are forecast to peak.
Underlying El Niño is the long-term trend of global warming, which is leading to more frequent and more intense extreme weather events, like drought and heat.
The drought has affected 481,000 people as of Monday, according to the civil defense agency in the state of Amazonas, where Manaus is located.
Late last week, workers from Brazilian NGO Fundação Amazônia Sustentável fanned out across the parched region near Manaus to deliver food and supplies to vulnerable villages. The drought has threatened their access to food, drinking water and medicines, which are usually transported by river.
Nelson Mendonca, a community leader in Santa Helena do Ingles, said some areas are still reachable by canoe, but many boats have not been able to bring supplies along the river, so most goods are arriving by tractors or on foot.
“It’s not very good for us, because we’re practically isolated,” he said.
Luciana Valentin, who also lives in Santa Helena do Ingles, said she is concerned about the cleanliness of the local water supply after the drought reduced water levels.
“Our children are getting diarrhea, vomiting, and often having fever because of the water,” she said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/15/americas/ecuador-election-gonzalez-noboa-intl-latam/index.html,"Noboa, 35, to become Ecuador’s next president following election dominated by spiraling crime",,,,CNN,"Center-right candidate Daniel Noboa, the 35-year-old son of a banana tycoon, will become Ecuador’s next president, following an election driven by concerns over rising violence and a worsening security situation in the Latin American nation.
More than 10 million people have voted in the presidential election, and data from the National Electoral Council of Ecuador (CNE) shows Noboa obtained 52.3% of the votes (4,829,130).
His main political rival, leftist candidate and first round front-runner Luisa González, obtained 47.7% of votes (4,404,014), the CNE said.
Noboa was a lawmaker before outgoing President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the legislature and called for early elections.
The Acción Democrática Nacional party’s candidate, he has pledged to create more work opportunities for the young, bring in more foreign investment, using technology to fight crime, and has suggested several anti-corruption measures including sentences for tax evasion.
Speaking to reporters after the result, Noboa thanked his wife, parents, and God for allowing him to serve his country.
“I also thank all those people who have been part of a new, young, improbable political project, a political project whose purpose was to give back a smile to the country,” he said.
“Starting tomorrow, Daniel Noboa, your president of the republic, starts working.”
His rival, González of the Movimiento Revolución Ciudadana party, a protégé of former leftist President Rafael Correa , ran on a promise to enhance public spending and social programs and wants to address the security crisis by fixing the root causes of violence, such as poverty and inequality.
González was the frontrunner in the first round of voting.
She conceded to Noboa after the result was announced, saying she would congratulate him on his victory.
“To the candidate now president-elect, we offer deep congratulations because it’s a democracy; we have never called for a city to be set on fire, we have never come out to shout fraud,” she said.
Security was tight throughout Sunday’s vote with tens of thousands of police officers and army personnel stationed at polling stations across the country.
Crime remained at the forefront of Ecuador’s run-off vote, months after the high-profile assassination of another presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, who was slain days before the August 20 first-round poll.

The killing became a tragic symbol of the country’s worsening security situation, where rival criminal organizations have been meting out brutal and often public shows of violence in the country’s streets and prisons in their battle to control drug trafficking routes.
Voter turnout was “historic” at 82.33% despite initial security concerns, CNE president Diana Atamaint said after polls closed Sunday.
“The transmission of the results has been fluid and constant; the Ecuadorians have permanently followed the votes obtained by each of the candidates, which are the result of the popular will expressed at the polls,” she Atamaint after the results came out.
“We have complied with a historic electoral process. The country gave us this mission, and today, we say to Ecuador and the entire world, ‘task accomplished;’ today democracy won, today Ecuador won.”

Before Ecuador, a nation of nearly 17 million, was transformed into one of the most dangerous countries in the region, it was known as a relatively peaceful place that was nestled between two of the world’s largest narcotics producers, Peru and Colombia.
Its deep ports, dollarized economy, and corruption have since made it a key transit point for drugs making its way to consumers in the US and Europe. The mounting violence , paired with a lack of economic prospects, have also compelled many Ecuadorians to leave the country.
“We are not sure [what] will put an end to this because we cannot live with that fear” of crime, small business owner César Ortiz told CNN en Español in Quito ahead of the poll.
Ortiz said he hopes the new president will focus not just on security but on the economy because “there are so many people who are unemployed, that is why crime [is] abound.”
Whoever wins on Sunday may gain a cursed chalice, say analysts covering the region. “Governing Ecuador right now is hell – this presidency is designed to eliminate you from political life,” Freeman said.
The new president will have relatively little time to work on a solution to the country’s woes. They will hold office only until 2025, which would have been the end of Lasso’s  term – a short window for even the most seasoned politician to turn things around in the country."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/americas/victor-jara-chilean-barrientos-arrest/index.html,Victor Jara killing: Suspect and Chilean national Pedro Barrientos is in custody after his US citizenship was revoked,,,,CNN,"A Chilean national who’s been wanted in that country in the killing of leftist singer-songwriter Victor Jara 50 years ago is now in custody in Florida, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.
Pedro Barrientos was arrested last week during a traffic stop in Deltona, Florida, ICE announced Tuesday.
Related article Charges brought in Chilean singer's death, 39 years later
Barrientos, a former military officer , was charged by a Chilean judge in 2012 in the brutal 1973 killing of Jara.
“Barrientos will now have to answer the charges he’s faced with in Chile for his involvement in torture and extrajudicial killing of Chilean citizens,” said John Condon, a special agent with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Tampa division, in a written statement Tuesday.
CNN has reached out to Barrientos’ attorneys for comment.
Jara, a communist sympathizer, was among the first victims of Chile’s military coup and dictatorship in 1973. His body was found with 44 bullet wounds and signs of torture.
“On Sept. 11, 1973, General Augusto Pinochet led a violent coup against Salvador Allende, the democratically elected president of Chile,” ICE said in its statement.
“In the following weeks, many people were detained and tortured in Chile Stadium, an indoor sports facility that the military commandeered as a de facto detention center,” ICE said. “Many disappeared or were executed. Victor Jara, a popular folk musician, was among the most famous victims.”
Barrientos later came to the US in 1990 and overstayed his visa, according to court documents, but was able to obtain US citizenship after marrying an American.
In 2016, a civil jury in Florida ruled that Barrientos was responsible for Jara’s death and found him liable for $28 million in damages to Jara’s surviving family members.
This summer, Barrientos’ citizenship was revoked after a judge found that Barrientos had lied in his citizenship application, failing to disclose his connection to Pinochet’s regime.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/10/americas/amazon-drought-floating-village-climate-intl/index.html,Amazon drought: Floating village stranded on dry lakebed as extreme drought grips the Amazon,,,,CNN,"A floating village now lies stranded on a lakebed in Brazil’s Amazon as severe drought leaves communities struggling to access food, fresh water and fuel.
Dramatically receding water levels in Lake Puraquequara, east of Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas, have left boats and floating buildings marooned in the mud.
It is the latest example of the devastating impacts of heat and drought on this part of Brazil – earlier this month more than a hundred river dolphins washed ashore dead as water temperatures soared – and authorities say the situation is set to get worse.
Lake Puraquequara is part of the Rio Negro river system, which has been near record-low since the end of September, according to the state’s civil defense authority. “Declining water levels are having a profound impact,” a spokesperson for the authority told CNN.
Some residents have resorted to digging wells in the cracked lakebed in an attempt to reach water.
“Our shops have no customers. We are isolated, boats cannot enter or leave the lake,” local resident Isaac Rodrigues told Reuters . “We’re going to be here until God sends us water.”
The severe drought extends across the state. Forty-two municipalities of the 62 in the state were in an emergency situation with more than 300,000 people affected, the civil defense authority told CNN Monday.
And the situation is expected to get worse. Around 500,000 people and 50 municipalities are likely to be affected over the next several weeks, “since we are still predicting a few months with reduced rain levels,” the spokesperson for the state authority said.
In late September, Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima declared a state of emergency and announced a package of assistance measures, including providing food to those most affected by the drought.
“There are many people already having difficulty accessing food, food security, drinking water and other important inputs,” he said in a statement at the time.
The drought is also devastating wildlife in the state’s rivers.
Scientists believe the unusual deaths of more than 100 dolphins in Lake Tefé, west of Manaus, at the beginning of October may be linked to the searingly high water temperatures.
“It’s still early to determine the cause of this extreme event but according to our experts, it is certainly connected to the drought period and high temperatures in Lake Tefé, in which some points are exceeding 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit),” the institute said in comments carried by CNN affiliate CNN Brasil.
It is currently the dry season in the Amazon, but the drought has been exacerbated by El Niño , a natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean and affects weather around the world.
Underlying El Niño is the long-term trend of global warming that is leading to more frequent and more severe extreme weather events, like drought and heat.
Swaths of South America, including Brazil, have been gripped by severe and deadly heat as the region moves from winter into spring.
This heat in August and September – during which Brazil experienced temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) – was made at least 100 times more likely by the human-caused climate crisis, according to a study published Tuesday by the World Weather Attribution initiative.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/americas/mexico-bus-crash-intl-latam/index.html,Mexico bus crash kills at least 16 migrants,,,,CNN,"A bus crash in the Mexican state of Oaxaca killed 16 people on Friday, according to local authorities, who say most of the passengers were migrants .
Three children and two women are among the victims, all of whom are from Venezuela and Haiti, the Oaxaca state attorney general said. At least 27 people were injured and transported to nearby hospitals.
Pictures posted by authorities on Facebook show the large bus flipped over and heavily damaged on a curve of the mountainous Oaxaca-Cuacnopalan highway.
Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, which took place at 5 a.m. local time (7 a.m. ET). The Oaxaca state attorney general’s office had first said 18 people died in the crash, then revised its count late on Friday evening.
The tragedy follows the deaths of at least 10 Cuban migrants, including a child, on Sunday, when the truck they were traveling in also overturned in southern Mexico, according to local authorities.
Venezuela and Haiti are sources of large numbers of migrants traveling northward, fleeing insecurity and economic crisis at home.
US and Mexican officials have struggled to respond to the arrivals, with Washington putting increasing pressure on Mexico City to shoulder more responsibility for people crossing its territory.
Food shortages and limited access to health care have driven more than 7.7 million people from Venezuela alone – a scale of displacement that outpaces Ukraine, where there’s an active war.
On Thursday, senior officials in the Biden administration said the US would restart deporting Venezuelans directly to Venezuela in an attempt to curb the record influx, marking a major shift in policy.
Haiti meanwhile is waiting for a new multinational mission to help bring order to the country, currently roiled by unchecked gang violence, kidnappings and food insecurity."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/americas/venezuela-juan-guaido-arrest-warrant-intl-hnk/index.html,Juan Guaido: Venezuela issues arrest warrant for US-based former opposition leader,,,,CNN,"Venezuelan authorities on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader and former interim president Juan Guaido , who dismissed the move as politically motivated.
During a press conference in the capital Caracas, Attorney General Tarek William Saab alleged that Guaido had used the state-owned oil company PDVSA’s resources to finance himself and pay his legal expenses.
“Juan Guaido used PDVSA resources to finance himself, pay his legal expenses, and forced PDVSA to accept his financing terms. These decisions caused losses to the nation of $19 billion, resulting in the almost definitive loss of Citgo,” Saab said, adding that Venezuela will request a red notice from Interpol.
“For this reason, we have opened a new investigation against former deputy Juan Guaido, and we have requested an arrest warrant against him,” he said.
Guaido served as the interim president of Venezuela’s transitional government from 2019 until late 2022 – when he was ousted from his leadership role after struggling to make significant gains against the authoritarian regime of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.
This spring, Guaido traveled to Miami, where he has remained. Speaking to CNN on Friday, he said, “Of course, I want to be back in Venezuela, but at least here I am alive and free, which is not the same for many Venezuelans who are behind bars or have been murdered by the dictatorship.”
Saab said the arrest warrant against Guaido will be for the alleged crimes of treason; usurpation of functions; profit or extraction of money, securities and public goods; money laundering; and association.
He also said that least 28 investigations are ongoing in the country against Guaido for a raft of alleged crimes including usurpation of functions, money laundering, terrorism, arms trafficking, and treason.

“Those who at some point believed in this guy and went out to march; they see that they found it to be a vulgar criminal of the worst caliber, robbing and kidnapping,” Saab said.
Guaido’s spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations, but during a live transmission on his Instagram account, Guaido described them as “false” and challenged President Maduro to submit to justice himself.
“This message goes to you, Maduro, tomorrow let’s meet at any prosecutor’s office in the US or, if you prefer, another jurisdiction, The Hague. We can then go directly to the jurisdiction that also points (to) you directly,” Guaido said.
In June, the International Criminal Court ruled that prosecutors should resume investigating alleged crimes against humanity in Venezuela by security forces under President Maduro.
“The question is, why now? Why did the dictatorship not do it before?” he said of the arrest warrant. “So no, Maduro, I did not allow you to kidnap me, I will not allow you to take away my voice, and I will continue to denounce you in all places where possible, as a criminal.”
Venezuela is due to hold a presidential vote in 2024, though critics have cast doubt on whether elections can be free and fair in the country’s repressive political climate.
Guaido called on his followers to vote in the upcoming opposition primary election on October 22, saying, “today the vote is kidnapped in Venezuela, but we have an opportunity to mobilize again to confront Nicolas Maduro.”
The US, which had long been a supporter of Guaido, has somewhat softened its stance toward Caracas as the region struggles with rising energy costs and hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants .
On Thursday, senior officials in the Biden administration said the US will restart deporting Venezuelans directly to Venezuela in an attempt to curb the record influx of crossings at the US-Mexico border, marking a major shift in policy.
Venezuelans who cross the US-Mexico border unlawfully and lack a legal basis to remain in the US will be eligible for removal, the senior administration officials said, adding that Venezuela had agreed to accept back its nationals.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the new policy “a key piece” of the administration’s approach to migration. Advocacy groups however have slammed the shift as dangerous for deportees; the policy will “likely lead to unsafe returns,” Refugees International warned in a statement.
In his interview with CNN on Friday, Guaido said he didn’t believe that the deportation deal was connected to his arrest. However, he did say that it underlined Maduro’s interest in gaining international recognition as Venezuela’s head of state.
“They are not going to stop the migration situation just by stopping migration or connect flights. We need to put a stop to the regime and recover rights in Venezuela,” Guaidó said.
“The only thing Maduro is looking for is recognition, and even with these deportation flights, he’s going to spin them as de facto recognition for his regime. That’s what he gets from this,” he continued.
“We never expected that Venezuelan migrants would reach the US directly, on foot, from Venezuela. Those are thousands of miles of desperation through the jungle. But we need to change the situation in Venezuela, bringing the country back to democracy, if we want to solve the migration crisis.”

She understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world.
She was a migrant child, too.
“My family’s case is the case of many refugees and migrants at the border. It was never a choice for our family to leave our home. We were forced out of it,” Rebellón, 32, said.
She was 10 when her family fled Cali, Colombia, because of death threats to her father, who had been forced into hiding. They settled in Miami, and with the support of teachers at school, Rebellón thrived. Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation , she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the US-Mexico border.
Rebellón moved from Miami to Los Angeles when she was 21 to pursue an acting career. In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana that she put her career on hold.
“There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said. “I couldn’t forget about what I had just seen. And I was like, ‘I literally have to go back.’”
Rebellón and her partner, Kyle Schmidt, used about $1,000 of their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the border. They enlisted volunteer teachers to provide learning opportunities in the camps.
“We set up a school overnight and … told just a couple of kids,” Rebellón said. “It spread throughout the camp, and we had like over 50 kids surrounding us.”
In the months that followed, when those families living in the camps were moved to shelters, Rebellón and Schmidt wanted to continue offering educational services.
“I thought, “Why don’t we turn a bus into a mobile classroom, and we could take it to all the different shelters?” Rebellón said. “We literally just Googled and YouTubed how to convert a bus into a mobile classroom.”
Over the next year, Rebellón and Schmidt bought and gutted a bus, partnered with shelters, and drove the transformed bus over the border. Their goal: to provide bilingual educational programs to keep children in school.
“All the families that we work with and all the children that we work with on a daily basis are legally seeking asylum,” Rebellón said. “They’re going through all the processes that are being required of them.”
Rebellón’s organization hires professional teachers and tailors their curriculum to the specific needs of each student. The program has been accredited by the education secretary in Mexico and serves children ages 3 to 15 – a crucial period for education, Rebellón says.
Despite the challenges she faced as a migrant child, she says she was lucky to have teachers who advocated for her and guided her along the way.
Many migrant children do not have this support and often fall through the cracks and miss valuable school time. Many have been on the road for months, if not years, and have difficulty attending school because they are often in transit, without a permanent home. Safety, economic instability, poverty, lack of transportation, and perceived legal status are also factors.
“People don’t realize that this is such a long process for families,” Rebellón said. “It’s not just like you arrive at the border, you seek asylum, and your life is all rainbows. It takes decades and a lot of work and a lot of pain.”
Rebellón’s family navigated a decades-long legal process to obtain political asylum and later US citizenship. Her parents, both lawyers by trade, were forced to abandon their careers in Colombia and take on new jobs in the US to support their family of five. Her mother worked multiple jobs as a caregiver and her father worked nights at Walmart. He has worked there full time for nearly 20 years.
“Any time I get a chance, I share my immigration story with (the kids),” Rebellón said. “I always want the kids that come through our programs to realize that being a migrant is not something they need to be ashamed of.”
Today, Yes We Can Foundation educates 250-300 kids a day through its four school locations along the border and three mobile school buses. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children from 10 countries.
Their program runs Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. School runs for the entire year, with no summer breaks. They also provide free uniforms, backpacks, and school supplies. Lessons focus on common core instruction in the subjects of language arts, math, and science as well as addressing practical and immediate needs like how to translate basic information including phone numbers and addresses.
“I want our efforts to be something permanent,” Rebellón said. “And that when it’s all said and done, we will be proud to look back and say that we were there when people needed us the most.”

Seated around a Ciudad Juárez conference room, the officials and their Mexican counterparts drafted a 15-point plan to help defuse the flashpoint – most of it a checklist of actions for the Mexican government. Notably, according to a readout from Mexico’s federal immigration agency, Mexico agreed to carry out more costly deportations of the migrants gathering on their side of the border – a move that some believed would dissuade disorderly crossings.
The measures, which also specified Mexican efforts to clamp down on the crush of migrants riding north on railcars, are the latest in a series of policy shifts in Mexico that have alleviated, if slightly, the massive political headache in Washington caused perennially by migration. Analysts in both countries see a pragmatic bargain: as Mexico increasingly carries the weight of US immigration strategy , the Biden administration has granted rare leeway to the country’s divisive but popular leader.
“Mexico has real leverage in the relationship with the US. And right now that leverage is around migration,” said Andrew Selee, the president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.
Sharing nearly 2,000 miles of land border and a history of important economic exchange, Mexico and the US have long held intertwined immigration policies that adapted as international migration patterns shifted. When George W. Bush made his first trip out of the US as president in 2001, it was to the ranch of Vicente Fox, the Mexican leader, to discuss a new era of cooperation on border issues, like trade, drugs, and the northward flow of Mexicans, who at that time comprised the bulk of undocumented border-crossers.
But as spiraling violence and desperate economic conditions fueled years of mass migration out of Central America and the Caribbean to the US, overpowering the country’s legal intake system, the stretch of Mexican territory in between became a critical “buffer state,” said Maureen Meyer of the Washington Office on Latin America.
“The Mexico southern border pretty much was the US southern border,” Meyer said.

Under pressure from several US administrations, Mexico has repeatedly sent resources to its border with Guatemala over the past 10 years to formalize migration routes and detained record numbers of migrants at newly installed checkpoints as they made their way north.
At the helm of Mexico’s latest immigration coordination with the US has been President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist leader who in 2018 campaigned on resistance to doing the US’s “dirty work” on migration. His political calculus has changed swiftly since then.
Under the threat of crippling tariffs from then-President Donald Trump, López Obrador agreed in 2019 to allow asylum applicants to wait out their claims inside Mexico under the “Remain in Mexico” policy, roiling activists who said it forced migrants into dangerous living conditions.
During the pandemic, when the US employed a public health measure known as Title 42 to turn around many asylum seekers at the border, López Obrador agreed to receive many of the migrants, reversing a long-standing position in the country and straining the resources of Mexico’s own border cities. In May, as the US ended the use of Title 42, López Obrador continued to allow the returns on “humanitarian grounds.”
“I think these more recent steps really do cross another line because it is not just stopping people from coming to the United States, which has been the more enforcer role,” Meyer said.
“It is actually allowing people deported from the United States to either stay in Mexico, or in this case now, actually maybe actively returning them back to their home countries for the United States,” she said.

Details on the deportation plan announced last month have been limited. In a news conference from Washington on Friday, Mexican Foreign Secretary Alicia Bárcena said that Mexican authorities were carrying out six flights each week to return migrants to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Bárcena added that officials were “exploring” the possibility of expanding the returns to Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia.
It was unclear where the deportation flights were taking place and when they had begun. It also couldn’t be learned if the migrants being returned had already been deported from the US or if they had pending asylum claims. Stakeholders in Mexico told CNN last week that there had not appeared to be any significant change in the pace of repatriation flights in the country’s north.
A spokeswoman for Mexico’s federal immigration agency declined to provide more details on the deportations.
But the announcement may already have had the effect of discouraging migrants from crossing to the US without the appointment required to seek an asylum claim. In the weekend that followed the meeting, the number of migrants encountered by border authorities entering the US near El Paso, Texas, fell by about 30%, CNN has reported.
Last Wednesday, López Obrador also announced that he was planning a summit with officials from several Latin American and Caribbean countries “whose populations are migrating” to be held in the coming days. Mexico also last month agreed to urge countries like Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba — which have limited diplomatic relations with the US — to take back their citizens deported at the border.
“What we are looking for is to reach an agreement to confront the migration phenomenon by addressing the causes,” López Obrador said at a news conference. “We have to align ourselves.”
The recent cooperation between the two countries has come with a busy schedule of shuttle diplomacy. Last week, Bárcena held meetings in Washington with Senate leaders and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Biden’s homeland security advisor. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Mexico this week along with other cabinet secretaries and meet with López Obrador.
For Mexican negotiators, the country’s increased responsibilities have often been conditioned on a US commitment to grow the ways that migrants can enter the country legally, like through temporary work visas and a recently expanded humanitarian parole program that the Biden administration says has allowed tens of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who meet certain conditions, including a local sponsor in the US, to fly into the country and secure work authorization.

Last month, ahead of the announcement around Mexican deportations, Mexico’s foreign minister told Bloomberg in an interview that the US and Mexico were nearing an agreement with the United Nations to pre-screen tens of thousands of migrants in Mexico for entry into the US under the parole programs. The US has opened similar processing centers in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.
A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson told CNN that the organization is “regularly in contact with US and Mexican authorities including on how we can provide support to possible future initiatives.”
“Politically for the Mexican government, they can’t do enhanced enforcement without showing that they are also fighting for the well-being of migrants and for legal opportunities, because it is a country with a history of migration to the United States,” Selee said.
Still, some analysts see a more cynical incentive behind the cooperation, arguing that the Biden administration has largely turned a blind eye to elements of López Obrador’s agenda that would have typically drawn rebuke.
“López Obrador very quickly understood that if he gave into Biden’s request for support he would have significant political capital to ensure that US pressure on a number of either bilateral issues or domestic Mexican policy issues would be constrained,” said Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington who has been a critic of the current administration.
Detractors point to democratic backsliding in a number of López Obrador’s positions: an attempted reform of the country’s independent election authority, frequent criticism of the judiciary and the press, and the capitulation of state powers on policing and transportation to the military.
The election reform, which was passed earlier this year but later blocked by the Mexican Supreme Court, diminished the country’s independent election authority, cutting its workforce across the country and limiting its autonomy ahead of a presidential vote next year.
Tens of thousands of Mexicans marched on the capital against the policy in the largest opposition protest of López Obrador’s presidency. Critics decried it as a dangerous erosion of democratic institutions.
But in Washington, the Biden administration was unusually muted. In a statement following the February protests, Ned Price, a senior adviser to Blinken, described “a great debate on electoral reforms on the independence of electoral and judicial institutions that illustrates Mexico’s vibrant democracy.”
“We respect Mexico’s sovereignty. We believe that a well-resourced, independent electoral system and respect for judicial independence support healthy democracy,” Price said.
If Mexico had less leverage in its relationship with the US, “I think that you’d see greater public pressure from the State Department, from the White House, on the slippery slope of democratic erosion that we’re seeing in Mexico,” Sarukhán said.
“I think the United States should be invested in Mexico’s democratic strength because if not, what you’ll have in Washington sooner or later is someone asking the question, ‘Who lost Mexico and why?’” he added."

But the opposition lambasted it as a “passing of the scepter.”
Constitutionally barred from running for reelection, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sought to show last month, in a very public way, that presidential candidate Claudia Sheinbaum has his blessing. So he handed his hoped-for successor an actual baton, in a ceremony outside a Mexico City restaurant not far from the National Palace – the seat of the country’s executive power.
Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old former Mexico City mayor and longtime political ally of Lopez Obrador, hit all the right notes in thanking him. Accepting the baton along with the leftist Morena party’s presidential nomination, Sheinbaum said she would assume “the full responsibility of continuing the course marked by our people, that of the transformation initiated by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.”

When Mexicans go to the polls next June, they will choose between two women for president – a first in the country’s history. Only four days before Morena nominated Sheinbaum, Mexico’s opposition coalition Broad Front chose another formidable female candidate, former senator Xochitl Gálvez from the conservative PAN party.
It’s not the first time Mexico sees women running for the presidency; before Sheinbaum and Gálvez, were six other female presidential candidates. But with the two major political sides nominating women, this is the first time that it’s practically a given that starting in December 2024, Mexico, a country previously known for machismo, will be run by a woman.
Still, some critics say the outgoing Lopez Obrador’s shadow looms over the contest.
Gálvez’s rise in Mexican politics has been meteoric; this spring, she said she wasn’t even the favorite of the PRI, PAN and PRD, the parties that now form the Broad Front coalition. It was a public spat with Lopez Obrador himself – who regularly attacked her as a “wimp,” “puppet,” and “employee of the oligarchy” in news conferences – that ultimately rocketed her into the spotlight.
In June, Gálvez went viral when she attempted to enter the National Palace with a judicial order that granted her the right to reply to the president, after successfully suing López Obrador. “This is not a show,” she told reporters at the doors of the National Palace.  “The law is the law, period.”
The daughter of an indigenous father and a mixed-race mother, Gálvez served as the top official for indigenous affairs under former President Vicente Fox before becoming a senator.  Unfiltered and irreverent, she described herself in an interview with CNN en Español as “an all-terrain, 4-by-4, kind of woman.”
Related article Mexico's president is on the attack. It's political 'gold' for his rival
In some respects, she appears progressive. Gálvez has advocated in the Mexican Congress for the rights and welfare of indigenous groups and Afro-Mexicans, and in a regional forum earlier this year in Monterrey, said that oil-rich Mexico should shift to renewable energy.  “We haven’t done it because we are dumbasses,” Gálvez unapologetically said.
She has also said leftist Lopez Obrador’s pension for all senior citizens should continue, and proposes what she calls a “universal social protection system” of welfare programs for a large portion of the middle and lower classes.
But when it comes to security and the fight against organized crime, Gálvez’s three-pronged plan is muscular, based on what she describes as “intelligence, heart and a firm-hand”: strengthening local and state police and giving them access to intelligence, advocating for and protecting victims, and respecting the rule of law.
Macario Schettino, a political analyst and Social Science professor at ITESM, a renowned Mexican university, describes Gálvez’s political momentum as impressive, considering that only a few months ago, she wasn’t even considered a candidate with a national profile. “She barely begun to register in political terms, and she’s already had great growth. Many people in Mexico still don’t know her.  She is going to grow [..] in popularity,” Schettino said, “While Claudia Sheinbaum can no longer move from where she is because she is already known by most Mexicans.”
Sheinbaum, a physicist with a doctorate in environmental engineering, would also be the first president with Jewish heritage if she wins, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist.
She is currently ahead in most polls, and will be a formidable opponent to beat. Not only does Sheinbaum have the full support of the governing party, she has also long enjoyed the spotlight as mayor of Mexico’s most important city for the last five years until her resignation in June to run for the presidency.
On policy, Sheinbaum has vowed to continue many of Lopez Obrador’s policies and programs, including a pension for all senior citizens, scholarships for more than 12 million students and free fertilizers for small farm owners. But the high-profile ex-mayor rejects criticism of her close political alignment with the president. “Of course we’re not a copy (of the president),” she said in July.
Still, she does not shy away from touting the principles they share: “For everybody’s good, let’s put the poor first.  There cannot be a rich government if the people are poor. Power is only a virtue when it’s used to serve the people,” Sheinbaum said, repeating the same campaign slogans Lopez Obrador has used for years.
Schettino believes the immensely popularly Lopez Obrador views Sheinbaum as his extension in power. He points to their party Morena’s roots in the authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico for more than seven decades until 2000, which came to be known as “The Dinosaur,” and the Party of Democratic Revolution that branched off from it.
In 2012, Lopez Obrador created Morena as a political party. Schettino describes the party today as a “tyrannosaurus” under Lopez Obrador’s influence – representing what he says is the current leader’s desire for a successor to hew closely to his own agenda. “President López Obrador, a dinosaur who not only is a dinosaur, but also has the vocation of a tyrant. He doesn’t want to go. He wants to stay in power,” Schettino said.
“I believe that he built Claudia’s candidacy,” Schettino said.
López Obrador however has repeatedly dismissed accusations of authoritarian leanings or that he favors a candidate he will be able to control.  Earlier this year, Lopez Obrador denied he had any favorites among his party’s hopefuls or that he was pushing for one candidate or another behind the scenes.
He has also said that he is going “retire completely” after his six-year term in office comes to an end. “I am retiring, I will not participate in any public event again, of course.  I am not going to accept any position, I do not want to be anyone’s advisor, much less am I going to act as a chief.  I am not going to have relations with politicians.  I am not going to talk about politics,” the president told press in February."

""The streets I used to walk are now barricaded with burnt-out vehicles as entire neighborhoods desperately try to protect themselves from gang-led abductions and attacks.""

The decision follows repeated calls for military assistance by Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry . United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the United States have also strongly urged the international community to back such a mission.
Thirteen members of the council voted in favor of the resolution, with Russia and China abstaining.
Though approved by the powerful UN Security Council, the force would not formally be under UN control. It is expected to be led by Kenya, which has pledged 1000 police to spearhead the mission. Several of Haiti’s Caribbean neighbors – Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica – have also offered support to the mission.
The “multinational security support” force will have a 12-month mandate in Haiti. The timing of its arrival is not set yet and more countries have been invited to participate. The resolution also calls for a global stop to arms sales to Haiti, except for approved security purposes.
An adviser to Haitian Prime Minister Henry, Jean-Junior Joseph, told CNN that the government welcomed the vote, adding, “We await with impatience the mission to combat general insecurity.”

The mission is expected to strengthen local security and to reinforce the Haitian National Police in its pursuit of the gangs. Haiti’s security forces already receive some international support but remain understaffed and outgunned.

Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 22, Prime Minister Henry told fellow nations that it was “urgent” that the Security Council approve a military mission to reestablish order. Violence has exacerbated broader instability across the country, Henry said, noting that inflation has soared past 50%, leaving 4.9 million Haitians struggling to eat – a dismal new record for the country.
In a statement the same day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the international community to support the plan and to provide assistance, including personnel, and said Washington was ready to provide “robust” financial and logistical assistance.
The Security Council has found itself in repeated deadlock in recent years amid deepening geopolitical rivalries. A statement by the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, described Monday’s decision on Haiti as “historic” and said the mission “speaks to the UN’s ability to galvanize collective action.”
Speaking in the Security Council after the vote, China’s UN ambassador Zhang Jun said his country had “a cautious and responsible approach” toward authorizing the use of force – but that in the case of Haiti, China’s abstention represented a “constructive position” toward the resolution.
Russia’s UN envoy Vassily Nebenzia criticized the move in remarks to the council, saying “that sending the armed forces of another state to any country even upon its request is an extreme measure that must be thoroughly thought through,” but noted “some positive elements” to the approved resolution.
Both Russia and China expressed approval of the resolution’s arms embargo.

Critics of the mission have previously pointed to scandals associated with UN peacekeeping missions in Haiti, including allegations of sexual abuse and the introduction of a deadly cholera epidemic, which killed nearly 10,000 people. Some Haitians also question the mandate of Prime Minister Henry, who took leadership of the country after President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021.
Henry has said that Haiti’s long-overdue elections cannot be held until the country reaches a basic level of security.
The United Nations’ special representative in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, said her office would support the mission “within the limits of its mandate,” while emphasizing that “unlike recent international missions deployed in Haiti, the MSS mission is not a UN mission.”

The alert said the incident happened in the Red Deer River Valley area of the park, which is in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.
“Parks Canada immediately mobilized a Wildlife Human Attack Response Team whose members are specially trained in responding to wildlife attacks,” Banff National Park said in the statement. “Weather conditions at the time did not allow for helicopter use, and the response team travelled through the night to the location by ground.”

Parks Canada staff euthanized the bear “to ensure public safety,” and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers arrived at the scene to assist in transporting the victims to Sundre, Alberta, about 75 miles northwest of Calgary, officials said.
“This is a tragic incident, and Parks Canada wishes to express its sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims,” the statement said.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/01/americas/mexico-migrant-children-culver/index.html,"They should be in elementary school, instead they speak like war veterans",,,,CNN,"The smell of burning wood and plastic hits us as we step out of the van. Smoke from campfires meets the cloud of dirt kicked up by our tires, stinging our eyes and leaving a scratch in our throats. In the near distance, you can hear children splashing and playing in the Suchiate River, which separates Mexico – where we are – from Guatemala.
We head toward the murky brown water, walking under tall, thick trees shielding us from the day’s brutal sun. We’re mindful of where we step, dodging scraps of cardboard used for beds and ducking under clothes hanging out to dry, careful not to intrude on someone’s personal space or modest belongings. It strangely feels more like a community rooted here for centuries, rather than a migrants’ campground.
And after the assault on the senses, comes the assault on the mind and the heart.
Stories abound from the people here, most originally from Venezuela, of why they left their homes and what they’ve gone through so far on their journeys to Ciudad Hidalgo. The adults sometimes become emotional but more shocking is the calm, matter-of-fact, narration from the children.
They had seen many dead people in the treacherous muddy jungle passage of the Darién Gap from Colombia to Panama, a group of young cousins tells me.
“I saw a woman, she had yellow hair and this part of her face was covered in blood,” says 9-year-old Mathias, gesturing to his right cheek.
I catch myself mid-interpretation from Spanish to English, realizing I am talking to children between the ages of 6 and 12 as they describe in vivid detail what they’ve experienced along the way.
“You get desperate in the jungle, you think you’re going to die in there,” Mathias says.
His 12-year-old cousin Sofia adds: “We ran out of food. We were starving for a night. … We all lost weight.” Her little brother Joandry lifts his shirt to show us his belly, as if to corroborate his sister and cousin’s accounts.
“It was hell,” Sofia says. “And every time you saw the end of the road, there was more to walk and we saw some dead people … lying on the ground.”
“It was hell,” 6-year-old Joandry corroborates again, looking at me with eyes that have seen far more than most adults.
The trauma from the trek they’ve endured already, mixed with the shared dreams of making it to the United States, bond many of the people on the banks of the Suchiate, especially the kids.
Sofia was the first to get our attention as she asks confidently and curiously what we’re doing here. We tell her we’re journalists. Her attention shifts to the water, and she excitedly points out to the river and one of the many rafts. “That’s my dad!” she tells us proudly. “He’s helping others come across.”
A few feet away, sitting on the ground and leaning up against a tree is Sofia’s mom, Susana. She’s holding her 2-year-old son as Sofia’s other younger siblings play close by. At first, Susana is more reserved – nodding for Sofia to answer our questions instead of her. But slowly she starts to open up, seemingly wanting to share their story.
Still in conversation with Sofia and Susana, I sit down on a concrete step under an open-air structure used for storing goods that are illegally moved across the river from Mexico to Guatemala. Sofia sits next to me as we look out to the armada of rafts going back and forth, with dozens more chained up and ready to deploy. They’re made of two large black inner tubes, tied together with rope and planks of wood across them to support goods and people.
Sofia’s dad, Jeandry, is one of the men who – like a gondolier on the canals of Venice – stands on the back with a long piece of wood steering the raft. At any given time, you can see across the river to Guatemala as up to a couple dozen migrants pile onboard and make the roughly 8-minute trip, illegally crossing into Mexico. Police are stationed a few hundred feet away, and the official crossing is within eyesight down river, but there’s no enforcement along the border just a near-constant free flow back and forth.
Sofia and her family say they took one of the rafts five days earlier. They’ve stayed on the riverbank instead of immediately continuing north to save up money, with Sofia’s dad working the rafts and the family asking for donations in the nearby town.
As I pull out a microphone, and my team starts recording with their cameras, Sofia’s siblings, aunt, uncle and cousins – who made the journey with them – crowd around. Little Joandry doesn’t want to miss out and hurries over with shampoo still in his hair, cackling as his older sister tries to clean it out.
“We’re thinking about Philadelphia [or] Chicago,” Sofia tells me, when I ask where in the US they’d like to go. Her 9-year-old cousin, Mathias, chimes in, “I’m thinking about New York or Florida.” Their parents look on, smiling as they’d told me moments earlier they had no idea where they’d end up; they just want to claim asylum and enter the US legally.
The kids smile too as they talk about their dreams to go to school. Sofia and Mathias want to be doctors, though Mathias might also want to be a lawyer, he tells me. When I ask what it’s been like traveling as a family, their faces turn expressionless for a moment. Solemn blank stares.
The families have been on the road for nearly two months, having left Colombia, where they lived for the past six years.
“We had to leave,” Sofia says. “We couldn’t stay poor there because every day we ate the same thing. There were times when we couldn’t eat at all because there was no money.”
Before Colombia, the families fled Venezuela, to get away from the corruption and crime. “And a bad economy,” Joandry explains, taking the microphone out of my hand as if taking over the interview.
As we talk and film, my team and I recognize a subtle difference in the migrants’ tone here in southern Mexico compared with those who we’ve met on multiple trips to cities bordering the US hundreds of miles farther north.
For everything they’ve been through, those in the south have yet to experience the extortion and threats from cartel-backed smugglers or the treacherous rides on top of freight trains. Looking at the parents’ eyes, I can sense they have heard murmurs of what’s ahead. Loved ones and friends have gone ahead of them and warned of the horrors.
But they manage to strike a hopeful tone. “It’s better than what’s behind us,” Mathias’ mom tells us. “We don’t go backwards; we move forward with God’s blessings.”
As we thank the children and their parents for their time, Sofia and Mathias excitedly ask if we want to swim with them. “I have to stay dry to work,” I tell them. “OK!” they shout, sprinting toward the water like any other boisterous children, their trauma buried, for now. Each one echoes the other as we part: “Nos vemos! See ya later!”

That’s good news for the country as a whole, but the island nation’s leopards are under threat.
Sri Lankan conservationist Anjali Watson says that as forests where leopards live are cleared to plant crops and build homes, the big cats are being squeezed into pockets of wilderness that don’t connect with each other.
“We’ve lost a lot of leopards,” says Watson. Nobody knows how many prowled the land before the war, but about 70% of the animals’ habitat has been destroyed, and only 750 to 1,000 adult leopards remain, she says.

What’s more, leopards are at risk of getting caught in snares. The wire traps are usually set for bushmeat species, including wild boar and deer, but they are indiscriminate in what they catch.
As Sri Lanka’s top predator, and its only big cat, the leopard “plays a key role” in Sri Lanka’s ecosystem, says Watson. “We call it an umbrella species,” she says, because taking steps to save leopards protects all the other species that share their forest home.
Watson grew up in the city of Colombo, but “I loved being out in wild spaces … I have a strong affinity with animals” she says.

In 1994 she moved to Ontario, Canada, to study at McMaster University, and met her future husband, Andrew Kittle.
A few years later the couple, who share a passion for wildlife, had settled in Sri Lanka. In 2000 they launched a pilot project to study leopards in Yala National Park in the island’s southeast. At the time, very little was known about the elusive animals, says Watson. To protect them, it was vital to understand their lives – and to count them.
Watson and Kittle, who went on to establish the Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) in 2004, currently work in four locations around Sri Lanka. They are investigating the size of the leopard population using remote cameras that take photos when they detect movement. Leopards that are caught on camera can be identified because each one has a unique pattern of spots – and famously, their spots never change.
Read: Google-backed project is collecting millions of wildlife camera-trap images
Installing the cameras is often grueling work, says Watson. It can involve long drives on spine-rattling, rocky tracks, clambering up hillsides, bushwhacking through jungle, and occasional encounters with elephants, bears and snakes, as well as leeches and ticks.
Out in the field, the team collects leopard scat to find out which animals they are hunting – leopards are not picky eaters and their diet includes deer, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and hares.
Watson hopes that WWCT’s data will help to shape development plans that make space for leopards. If corridors between forest patches and buffer zones around protected areas are safeguarded, both humans and animals could thrive. Watson is dedicated to ensuring that these “beautiful, fabulous creatures” survive."
https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/asia/fukushima-wildlife-intl-scli-scn/index.html,Wildlife flourishing in uninhabited areas around Fukushima,,,,CNN,"Nearly a decade after Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination.
On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes.
Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area.
Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.
Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species – including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.
“Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,” James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.

Photographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.
Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited.
In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people.
Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones.
Species considered to be “in conflict” with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.

While the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted.
The study was published Monday in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, was produced in addition to the team’s research on Chernobyl, where wildlife has also thrived in the wake of the disaster."
https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/tech/autox-robotaxi-china-intl-hnk/index.html,Self-driving robotaxis are taking off in China,,,,CNN,"The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars for years . In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.
On Thursday, AutoX, an Alibaba (BABA) -backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.
Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside.
This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn’t restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.
The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city’s downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin.
It also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.
“It’s a dream,” AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. “After working so hard for so many years, we’ve finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.”
Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. “We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,” he said. “The AI software is better [now.]”
“From a technical point of view, the car is ready,” Xiao said. “It’s very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.”
AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called “Professor X.” The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.
The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won’t change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.
While AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it’s not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.
In October, Alphabet’s Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)
Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it’s like to ride in a self-driving car.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.
In June, Didi, China’s biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.
Recently, Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) also announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.
AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.
In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba’s Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app.

The startup’s latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.
Some of the company’s lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.
“The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,” he added. “For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.”
China, home to the world’s biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.
The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.
“The bar is incredibly high,” he said. “It’s extremely challenging, but we’re very happy.”"

https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/europe/ukraine-russia-war-next-stages-intl/index.html,Russia is bruised as winter approaches. Can Ukraine land another blow?,,,,CNN,"The relative calm in Ukrainian cities far from the country’s battlefields was shattered by two painfully familiar sounds this week: the ominous ring of the air raid sirens, and the eruptions of Russian attacks .
A wave of missiles, rockets and drones has struck dozens of locations across Ukraine since Monday, according to officials, targeting civilian infrastructure in several major cities, including Kyiv, located hundreds of miles from the front lines in the east and south.
The wide bombardment echoed the early days of Russia’s scattershot initial invasion in February, but also underlined that the conflict in Ukraine , which for months appeared to be descending into a slow and painful grind in the Donbas, has erupted once again as winter nears.
Not for the first time, the war is teetering towards an unpredictable new phase. “This is now the third, fourth, possibly fifth different war that we’ve been observing,” said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia Programme.
Related article LIVE UPDATES: Russia's war in Ukraine
The strikes followed weeks of Ukrainian ground gains and began two days after a huge explosion damaged the Kerch bridge , the only crossing between the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russia. That blast, which was used by the Kremlin as a justification for Monday’s onslaught, bruised the Russian psyche and handed Ukraine a significant strategic boost.
With the cold months nearing and likely bringing a slowdown in ground combat, experts say the next weeks of the war are now expected to be vital, and another potential spike in intensity looms over Ukraine as each side seeks to strike another blow.
“What seemed a distant prospect for anything that could be convincingly described as a Ukraine victory is now very much more plausible,” Giles said. “The response from Russia is likely to escalate further.”
Monday’s attacks, and further strikes throughout the week, were evidence of Russian President Vladimir Putin lashing out after a series of setbacks in the war that have put him under pressure domestically.
And the airborne strikes distract from what has been a dismal stretch for Russia in the ground war.
Oleksii Hromov, a senior Ukrainian military official, said last week that Kyiv’s forces have recaptured some 120 settlements since late September as they advance in the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson regions. On Wednesday, Ukraine said it had liberated more five settlements in its slow but steady push in Kherson.
Russia said Thursday its forces would help evacuate residents of occupied Kherson to other areas, as Ukraine’s offensive continued to make gains in the region. The announcement came shortly after the head of the Moscow-backed administration in Kherson appealed to the Kremlin for help moving residents out of harm’s way, in the latest indication that Russian forces were struggling in the face of Ukrainian advances.
These counter-offensives have shifted the momentum of the war and disproved a suggestion, built up in the West and in Russia during the summer, that while Ukraine could stoutly defend territory, it lacked the ability to seize ground.
“The Russians are playing for the whistle – (hoping to) avoid a collapse in their frontline before the winter sets in,” Samir Puri, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the author of “Russia’s Road to War with Ukraine,” told CNN.
“If they can get to Christmas with the frontline looking roughly as it is, that’s a huge success for the Russians given how botched this has been since February.”
Faced with growing setbacks, the Kremlin appointed a new overall commander of Russia’s invasion. But there is little sign that Gen. Sergey Surovikin can lead his forces back onto the front foot before the end of the year, given the pace and cost of the Ukrainian counter-offensives.
Related article Russia's hit-and-miss missile blitz forces a frantic race to shore up Ukrainian defenses
Ukrainian troops are focused primarily on pushing Russian forces eastwards, having crossed the Oskil River in late September, with Moscow likely preparing to defend the cities of Starobilsk and Svatove in the Luhansk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
Landing a major blow in Donbas would send another powerful signal, and Ukraine will be eager to improve on its gains before temperatures plummet on the battlefield, and the full impact of rising energy prices is felt around Europe.
“There are so many reasons why there is an incentive for Ukraine to get things done quickly,” Giles said. “The winter energy crisis in Europe, and energy infrastructure and power being destroyed in Ukraine itself, is always going to be a test of resilience for Ukraine and its Western backers.”
NATO leaders have vowed to stand behind Ukraine regardless of how long the war takes, but several European countries – particularly those that relied heavily on Russian energy – are staring down a crippling cost-of-living crisis which, without signs of Ukrainian progress on the battlefield, could endanger public support.
Recent days have meanwhile shown that sites beyond the current theater of ground fighting are far from immune to attacks. It remains unclear exactly how the Kerch bridge bombing was carried out – and Kyiv has not claimed responsibility – but the fact that a target so deep in Russian-held territory could be successfully hit hinted at a serious Ukrainian threat towards key Russian assets.
Russia is struggling on the ground and has failed to achieve supremacy in the air, but Monday’s attacks may have achieved one goal – sending a signal of strength towards the growing list of Putin’s internal critics.
The assault damaged civilian infrastructure in cities all across Ukraine, killing multiple people and knocking out power in pockets of the country. They were “an indication of the nature of the threat from Russia,” Giles said. “For many months now, the Russian objective has been to destroy Ukraine rather than possess it.”
Ukraine’s national electricity company, Ukrenergo, says it has stabilized the power supply to Kyiv and central regions of Ukraine after much of the country’s electricity supply was disrupted by Russian missile attacks on Monday and Tuesday. But Ukrainian Prime Minister has warned that “there is a lot of work to do” to fix damaged equipment, and asked Ukrainians to reduce their energy usage during peak hours.
Experts believe it remains unlikely that Russia’s aerial bombardment will form a recurrent pattern; while estimating the military reserves of either army is a murky endeavor, Western assessments suggest Moscow may not have the capacity to keep it up.
“We know – and Russian commanders on the ground know – that their supplies and munitions are running out,” Jeremy Fleming, a UK’s spy chief, said in a rare speech on Tuesday.
That conclusion was also reached by the ISW, which said in its daily update on the conflict Monday that the strikes “wasted some of Russia’s dwindling precision weapons against civilian targets, as opposed to militarily significant targets.”
“Russia’s use of its limited supply of precision weapons in this role may deprive Putin of options to disrupt ongoing Ukrainian counter-offensives,” the ISW assessed.
Exactly how much weaponry and manpower each side has left in reserve will be crucial to determining how the momentum will shift in the coming weeks. Ukraine said it intercepted 18 cruise missiles on Tuesday and dozens more on Monday, but it is urging its Western allies for more equipment to repel any future attacks.
“The barrage of missile strikes is going to be an occasional feature reserved for shows of extreme outrage, because the Russians don’t have the stocks of precision munitions to maintain that kind of high-tempo missile assault into the future,” Puri said.
Some help for Putin may be on the way, however. An announcement by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Belarus and Russia will “deploy a joint regional group of troops” raised fears of deepened military cooperation between the close allies and that Belarusian troops could formally join Russia in its invasion. Belarus has been complaining of alleged Ukrainian threats to its security in recent days, which observers say could be a prelude to some level of involvement.
Related article The Crimea attack triggered a wave of strikes on Ukraine. But mystery swirls over who blew up Putin's bridge
The impact of such an intervention in terms of pure manpower would be limited; Belarus has around 45,000 active duty troops, which would not significantly bolster Russia’s reserves. But it would threaten another assault on Ukraine’s northern flank below the Belarusian border.
“The reopening of a northern front would be another new challenge for Ukraine,” Giles said. It would provide Russia a new route into the Kharkiv oblast (region), which has been recaptured by Ukraine, should Putin prioritize an effort to reclaim that territory, he said.
Any further Belarusian involvement in the war could also have a psychological impact, Puri suggested. “Everyone’s mind in Ukraine and in the West has been oriented towards fighting one army,” he said. Inside Russia, Belarus joining the invasion “would play into Putin’s narrative that this war is about reuniting the lands of ancient Rus states.”
By flipping the narrative of the conflict over the past two months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has achieved one of his own key objectives: showing Ukraine’s Western allies that their military aid can help Kyiv win the war.
Now Zelensky will hope for more supplies in the short-term as he seeks to drive home those gains. The leader has sought to highlight Ukraine’s success in intercepting Russian missiles, saying more than half of the missiles and drones launched at Ukraine in a second wave of strikes on Tuesday were brought down.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Ukraine needed “more” systems to better halt missile attacks, ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
“These air defense systems are making a difference because many of the incoming missiles [this week] were actually shot down by the Ukrainian air defense systems provided by NATO Allies,” he said.
“But of course, as long as not all of them are shot down, of course there is a need for more,” Stoltenberg added.
Related article Biden promises Ukraine 'advanced air defense systems' after Russian missile strikes
Justin Bronk, a military expert with the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), agreed with that assessment, telling CNN that, “Ukrainian interception success rates against Russian cruise missiles have risen significantly since the start of the invasion in February.”
Ukraine “badly needed” modern systems such as the IRIS-T that arrived this week from Germany and the NASAMS expected from the United States, Bronk said.
Beyond weapons supplies, Ukraine will be watching to ensure that Western resolve stays firm if Russia tightens energy supplies even further.
“There are many things Russia can do to make the war personal, not just for people of Ukraine but around Europe, to try to force pressure on governments to remove their support for Ukraine,” Giles said.
This week’s air strikes may point towards that endeavor; Ukraine’s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko told CNN that around 30% of energy infrastructure in Ukraine was hit by Russian missiles on Monday and Tuesday. The minister told CNN that this was the “first time from the beginning of the war” that Russia has “dramatically targeted” energy infrastructure.
The coming weeks are therefore crucial both on the battlefield, as well as in Europe and around the globe, experts suggest. “As ever, where Putin goes next depends on how the rest of the world is responding,” Giles said. “Russia’s attitude is shaped by the failure of Western countries to confront and deter it.”
It means that, as winter approaches, the stakes of the war have been raised once more. “There’s no doubt Russia would like to keep it up,” Giles said. But the Ukrainian successes of recent weeks have sent a direct message to the Kremlin, too. “They are able to do things that take us by surprise, so let’s get used to it,” Giles said.

Robert F. Sargent, a chief photographer's mate in the US Coast Guard, was aboard one of the many Higgins boats heading toward the shores of Normandy, France, at the start of the D-Day invasion . With him were soldiers from the US Army's 1st Infantry Division, cold and soaked from the choppy waters.
""Smoke hung over everything,"" Sargent later told Coast Guard Combat Correspondent Thomas Winship , ""and as the coxswain opened his throttle to drive into the beach we saw the enemy-placed obstacles, a tangled mess of timbers, barbed wire and hidden mines.""
From afar, the beach ahead of Sargent's boat looked lifeless and deserted. Then he glanced over at another nearby boat and saw the water between them being pelted by German bullets ""like a mud-puddle in a hailstorm. It seemed impossible that we would make it without being riddled.""
When the boats reached sandbars, their bow doors dropped and their ramps went down, releasing the soldiers into shallow water that they would have to wade through while being fired at by German machine guns. Many would not make it to shore.
This is the scene that Sargent captured with his famous photo ""Into the Jaws of Death."" It is one of the most widely reproduced photos from the Normandy landings, which laid the foundation for the Allied defeat of Germany in World War II.
This year marks the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the largest amphibious invasion in history . There were many Allied casualties that day — around 4,440 Allied troops were confirmed dead, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, with more than 5,800 troops wounded or missing. But by midnight, the Allies had secured their beachheads and moved further inland.
Sargent stayed on the boat, which returned to the USS Samuel Chase to bring more waves of troops to the shore. He carried his film in a metal milk can to keep it safe.
""The coast of France this morning was certainly no photographer's party,"" he told Winship. Sargent died in 2012."

https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/12/sport/dana-white-ufc-domestic-violence-spt-intl/index.html,UFC president Dana White does not expect punishment for domestic violence incident,,,,CNN,"Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) president Dana White said he does not expect punishment after a video emerged of him in a physical altercation with his wife earlier this month. White made the comments Wednesday at a media day for UFC Fight Night 217.
Asked whether he expects there to be repercussions from the company, White said: “What should the repercussions be? You tell me. I take 30 days off? How does that hurt me?
“Me leaving hurts the company, hurts my employees, hurts the fighters. It doesn’t hurt me.
“What is my punishment? Here’s my punishment: I have to walk around for however long I live … and this is how I’m labeled now.
“The punishment is that I did it, and now I have to deal with it.”
In the video, obtained by TMZ, White and his wife, Anne, are seen arguing before exchanging slaps in a nightclub in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on New Year’s Eve. Neither White nor his wife are facing legal charges over the incident.
White claims that conversations had been held between himself, Endeavor chief executive and UFC owner, Ari Emanuel, and broadcaster ESPN over what action was appropriate.
“We’ve had plenty of discussions internally – with Ari, with ESPN – nobody’s happy,” the 53-year-old said. “Nobody’s happy about this. Neither am I. But it happened.”
White also said he was not looking to make excuses for his behavior and reiterated his stance on domestic violence.
“There’s never an excuse … There’s no defense for this and people should not be defending me over this thing, no matter what.”
On Monday, the California Legislative Women’s Caucus wrote an open letter to Emanuel and Endeavor calling for White to be replaced as UFC president.
“Given Mr White’s previous remarks against domestic partner violence, we believed that Endeavor and the UFC shared this commitment to safety, respect and accountability,” the letter reads.
“And yet, we have seen the video of UFC president Dana White, where he strikes his wife at a New Year’s Eve celebration … We were appalled. It was alarming to say the least. In the days since the video was released, you have remained silent.
“We are calling for the immediate removal of Mr White as president of UFC.”
CNN reached out to Endeavor for comment but did not immediately get a response.

The 35-year-old only returned to training in the new year after taking some time off to celebrate and recuperate after Qatar 2022, where he finally won the trophy that had always eluded him in one of the greatest finals ever .
But the forward didn’t look to be suffering any hangover as he returned to action with a goal from close range in PSG’s 2-0 win against Angers on Wednesday.
Messi also paid tribute to Pelé before the match, joining his teammates in wearing a t-shirt with the Brazilian’s face on it during the warmup.
PSG sits comfortably top of the league despite Christophe Galtier having to switch up his team as he eases players back in after the World Cup.
Kylian Mbappé, a beaten finalist in Qatar, was rested for Wednesday’s match, allowing the likes of youngster Hugo Ekitiké to get some game time.
The 20-year-old forward has impressed when given the chance this season and opened the scoring with a sweeping finish in the first half.
Messi, who dovetailed the attack alongside Neymar Jr., then doubled the lead in the 72nd minute after a well timed run and right foot finish.
The linesman had initially flagged for offside, but the Virtual Assistant Referee (VAR) overruled the call and the goal was given.
The win on Messi’s return is some welcome good news for PSG, who lost in the league for the first time this season last week, 3-1 away to Lens.
“Yes, it was very important to get back to winning ways. We have rivals who are pushing hard,” Galtier told PSGTV after the game.
“We knew that we were going to have a difficult match because Angers is a team that plays good football and poses big problems on a tactical level.
“I also insist on the fact that the situation – post-World Cup – means that we have had a lot of players absent, that the group was very scattered and that, little by little, everyone is coming back and reconnecting.”
PSG, which is six points clear atop the table, plays Rennes in its next game on Sunday."

Ahead of the Sony Open in Hawaii, US captain Johnson said he wouldn’t discount selecting Woods to compete in the tournament if the 47-year-old didn’t qualify for the team automatically.
“I would only contemplate having him on the team if he felt – if he was putting up some numbers and some scores, No. 1, where he’s showing some sign of being competitive, “Johnson said at a media conference on Wednesday.
“And then No. 2, that discussion would be had with the other guys that are a part of that team, and specifically him. If there is anything I trust in Tiger Woods, is that he’s extremely invested in this team and the future Cups. Extremely invested. I can’t speak that enough,” added Johnson.
“And then I think you would do anything and everything for the betterment of the team. I assume he would say … I don’t like basing on assumptions … but I’m confident that he would say, ‘Yeah, I can play, or no, I can’t.’”
Last year, Johnson confirmed Woods would be part of the US Ryder Cup “in some capacity,” adding that Woods had made it a “priority.”

“Given who he is and what he’s all about, I can’t tell you right now: I don’t know if he will be here next year, but he will be a part of this team in some capacity,” Johnson said.
However, Woods’ health could complicate this, Johnson conceded.
“He’s gone through some things as of late that make it difficult, whether it’s travel or what-have-you,” said the US Ryder Cup captain.
Injury has hampered Woods’ recent career, his playing time decimated since he suffered serious leg injuries in a car accident in February 2021.
The 47-year-old withdrew from the Hero World Challenge in December citing his foot pain, and at various points had looked to be struggling with movement during the seventh edition of The Match that month.
“I think something that is realistic is playing the tour one day, never full time, ever again, but pick and choose, just like Mr. (Ben) Hogan did,” Woods told Golf Digest after his accident in 2021.
“Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that. You practice around that, and you gear yourself up for that. And you play. I think that’s how I’m going to have to play it from now on.
“It’s an unfortunate reality, but it’s my reality. And I understand it, and I accept it.”
A biennial competition which alternates between Europe and the US, the Ryder Cup is being played in Italy for the first time later this year – September 25 to October 1 – at the Marco Simone Golf & Country Club, which is 10 miles from the center of Rome.
Team US regained the Ryder Cup in 2021 following a historically dominant performance over Europe at Whistling Straits.

World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz may be missing the tournament through injury, but with the return of Novak Djokovic to the competition, Nadal will be hard pushed to defend his title.
Thursday’s draw was not kind to the 22-time major winner: if he defeats the world No. 40 Draper, he potentially faces current Next Gen ATP Finals champion Brandon Nakashima.
Potentially awaiting the Spaniard later would be a quarterfinal against Daniil Medvedev, who was Nadal’s opponent in last year’s epic five-set final. Medvedev will be looking to make it a third consecutive finals appearance after losing to Djokovic in 2021 and to Nadal in 2022.
A rematch of the 2021 final is on the cards, with Djokovic in the opposite half from Nadal and Medvedev. The nine-time Australian Open champion faces another Spaniard, Roberto Carballes Baena, in the opening round and is on track to face home favorite Nick Kyrgios in the last eight.
The tournament comes 12 months after Djokovic was deported from Australia on the eve of the 2022 edition after former immigration minister Alex Hawke found the tennis star posed a risk to public health and order because, as a celebrity sportsman who had previously expressed opposition to people being compelled to get the Covid-19 vaccine, he could be seen as an “icon” for anti-vaxxers.
The minister’s decision to deport the former world No. 1 meant he was initially banned from reentry for three years.
Nineteenth-seeded Kyrgios is part of a thrilling section of the draw which includes Holger Rune, Dan Evans and Andrey Rublev.
Russian Rublev comes into the Australian Open as the fifth seed, but on Wednesday suffered a shock defeat to world No. 110 Thanasi Kokkinakis in the Adelaide 2. Rublev faces a blockbuster opening round match against former world No. 3 and 2020 Australian Open finalist Dominic Thiem.
Andy Murray features in the other pick of the round as he faces 13th-seeded Matteo Berrettini. The Italian beat the three-time grand slam winner in four sets at the 2022 US Open and has beaten the Scotsman three out of their four ATP meetings.
Following reigning champion Ashleigh Barty’s retirement from tennis last year, Iga Światek has dominated the sport and comes into the tournament as the top seed. The Pole opens against German Jule Niemeier but faces a tasty potential quarterfinal clash with American hot prospect Coco Gauff.
The 18-year-old superstar comes into the tournament in fine form, having won the ASB Classic without dropping a set and is looking to build on her excellent 2022 which saw her reach the Roland Garros final where she was beaten by Światek.
Ahead of any quarterfinal clash with the favorite though, Gauff faces a second round match against 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu who is in a race against time to recover from an ankle injury.
In the other half of the draw, second seed Ons Jabeur starts her 2023 trying to go one better than last year and win a grand slam. The Tunisian made both the Wimbledon and US Open finals but fell at the final hurdle in her pursuit to become the first Arab and North African woman to win a grand slam.
After missing the 2022 Open, Jabeur opens her 2023 account against Tamara Zidanšek and could face Aryna Sabalenka who is coming off the back of winning at Adelaide 1, her 11th career title and first in 19 months.
Elsewhere, American Jessica Pegula has been drawn in the same part of the draw as Maria Sakkari. Pegula recently led Team USA to victory in the inaugural United Cup, which featured a brilliant straight-set win over Światek. Having reached back-to-back quarterfinals in Melbourne and at the top of her game, she will be looking to set up a thrilling semifinal with her United Cup opponent."

Brown scored season-high 41 points and had 12 rebounds while Tatum had 31 points and 10 rebounds as the Celtics won their fourth straight game.
Brown specifically attacked the Pelicans from the mid range, crediting extra muscle added in the offseason for allowing him to handle contact with bigger opponents, as he makes a concerted effort to not settle for attempts from deep.
“I think I can get to the rim at a good rate this year,” Brown told reporters afterwards, per the Celtics website. “I definitely want to keep that up.
“I don’t want to let the defense off the hook, but I feel good about a lot of the shots I took from three. Some of them went down, some of them haven’t. But I definitely still think I’m going to look to get to the basket a lot more for sure just for the remainder of the year.”
Celtics forward Al Horford reiterated the point: “When (Brown) drives, I feel like people feel it.
“When he’s hitting you when he’s driving, that’s real. So it’s good to see him play at that level and have his mind made up that he’s going to attack the paint.”
It was Brown’s sixth 40-point game of his career, moving him past Sam Jones and Isaiah Thomas for the sixth-most in Celtics history.
Together with Tatum, the two wing players have become the driving force behind Boston’s recent success.
The team reached the NBA Finals last season, eventually losing to the Golden State Warriors, and is again one of the best in the league this year.
In both scoring at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in the same game, Brown and Tatum became the first Celtics players to achieve that stat line since Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker in 2001.
Drafted a year after one another – Brown was drafted with the No. 3 pick in the 2016 draft and Tatum was selected with the No. 3 pick in 2017 – they have built up an understanding together about dissecting defenses.
“They continue to grow in front of our eyes,” Horford said of the star duo after the victory. “They feed off each other, and that’s what really drives our team.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/12/sport/australia-afghanistan-cricket-taliban-intl-hnk-spt/index.html,Australia pulls out of Afghanistan cricket series over Taliban’s restrictions on women,,,,CNN,"Australia’s men’s cricket team has withdrawn from a series of upcoming matches against Afghanistan in protest over the ruling Taliban’s restrictions on women and girls’ education and employment, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement Thursday.
The teams were scheduled to play three One Day International (ODI) games in the United Arab Emirates in March, but CA decided to cancel the series after “extensive consultation” with “several stakeholders including the Australian government,” the statement said.
“CA is committed to supporting [and] growing the game for women and men around the world, including in Afghanistan, and will continue to engage with the Afghanistan Cricket Board in anticipation of improved conditions for women and girls in the country,” it added.
In December, the Taliban announced the suspension of university education for all female students. The move followed a decision in March to bar girls from returning to secondary schools, coming after months-long closures that had been in place since the hardline Islamist group took over Afghanistan in August 2021.

Later that month, the Taliban ordered all local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to stop their female employees from coming to work, warning that non-compliance would result in the revocation of their licenses.
The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) responded to CA’s decision on Thursday, describing it as “pathetic” and “an attempt to enter the realm of politics and politicize the sport.”
“By prioritizing political interests over the principles of fair play and sportsmanship, Cricket Australia is undermining the integrity of the game and damaging the relationship between the two nations,” the statement added.
“The decision to withdraw from playing the upcoming ODI series against Afghanistan is unfair and unexpected and will have a negative impact on the development and growth of cricket in Afghanistan, as well as affect[ing] the love and passion of the Afghan nation for the game.”
The ACB said it was considering what action to take on the matter, including the possibility of writing to the International Cricket Council (ICC) and “rethinking the participation of Afghan players” in Australia’s domestic Twenty20 competition, the Big Bash League (BBL).
The ACB statement followed comments from prominent Afghan player Rashid Khan.
Khan, who played for the Adelaide Strikers in this year’s BBL, accompanied a statement on Twitter with the words: “Keep politics out of it.”

“I am really disappointed to hear that Australia have pulled out of the series to play us in March,” Khan wrote.
“I take great pride in representing my country and we have made great progress on the world stage. This decision from CA sets us back in that journey.
“If playing vs Afghanistan is so uncomfortable for Australia then I wouldn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable with my presence in the BBL. Therefore I will be strongly considering my future in that competition.”
CA had previously backed out of a proposed Test match against Afghanistan due to be hosted in Tasmania in November 2021 over the Taliban’s ban on women participating in sports.
“Driving the growth of women’s cricket globally is incredibly important to Cricket Australia. Our vision for cricket is that it is a sport for all, and we support the game unequivocally for women at every level,” CA said at the time.
Australia’s sports minister Anika Wells on Thursday said Canberra supports Cricket Australia’s move.
“The Australian government welcomes Cricket Australia’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming men’s One Day International series against Afghanistan, following the Taliban’s increased suppression of women and girls’ rights,” she tweeted.
Although the Taliban repeatedly claimed it would protect the rights of girls and women, the group has done the opposite, stripping away the hard-won freedoms for which women have fought tirelessly over the past two decades.
The United Nations and at least half a dozen major foreign aid groups have said they are temporarily suspending their operations in Afghanistan following the ban on female NGO employees."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/11/sport/damar-hamlin-buffalo-bills-hospital-release-spt/index.html,Damar Hamlin discharged after spending more than a week hospitalized due to a cardiac arrest,,,,CNN,"Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin has been discharged from a Buffalo medical center, his club said Wednesday, after more than a week of hospitalization due to a cardiac arrest he suffered during a “Monday Night Football” game this month.
The 24-year-old Bills safety had been showing signs of accelerated improvement in the days leading up to his release from Buffalo General Medical Center in New York, hospital officials had said .
“We have completed a series of tests and evaluations, and in consultation with the team physicians, we are confident that Damar can be safely discharged to continue his rehabilitation at home and with the Bills,” a physician leading Hamlin’s care in Buffalo, Dr. Jamie Nadler, said in a statement the Bills released Wednesday on Twitter.

Hamlin initially was hospitalized in Cincinnati when his heart suddenly stopped after a tackle during a game against the host Cincinnati Bengals on January 2, but was transferred to the Buffalo facility Monday after doctors determined his critical condition had improved enough for the move.
Doctors at the Buffalo hospital were trying to determine why Hamlin suffered the cardiac arrest, Kaleida Health, the group of hospitals that includes the Buffalo medical center, said before his discharge. That included whether pre-existing conditions played a role in the event, which shocked many around the country and prompted a huge outpouring of support for the second-year NFL player.
On Tuesday, Hamlin went through “a comprehensive medical evaluation as well as a series of cardiac, neurological and vascular testing,” the Bills said on Twitter.
No cause of Hamlin’s cardiac arrest has been publicly announced.
“Special thank-you to Buffalo General it’s been nothing but love since arrival! Keep me in y’all prayers please!” Hamlin tweeted Tuesday.
It will be up to Hamlin to decide when he will be around the team again while recovering, Bills coach Sean McDermott said Wednesday.

“Grateful first and foremost that he is home with his parents and his brother, which is great,” McDermott told reporters Wednesday, as the Bills prepared to host the Miami Dolphins for a playoff game Sunday . No timetable for Hamlin’s return to professional football has been announced.
“We’ll leave (when he’ll be around the team) up to him. His health is first and foremost in our mind as far as his situation goes and when he feels ready, we will welcome him back,” McDermott said.
While in critical condition in Cincinnati, Hamlin was sedated and on a ventilator for days. On Friday morning the breathing tube was removed, and Hamlin began walking with some help by that afternoon, his doctors said Monday.
The health care team focused on stabilizing Hamlin and upgraded his condition Monday because his organ systems were stable and he no longer needed intensive nursing or respiratory therapy, doctors said.
“He’s certainly on what we consider a very normal to even accelerated trajectory from the life-threatening event that he underwent,” Dr. Timothy Pritts, chief of surgery at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said earlier this week. “He’s making great progress.”
Normal recovery from a cardiac arrest can be measured in weeks to months, Pritts said Monday. Hamlin had been beating that timeline at each stage and is neurologically intact.
When Hamlin collapsed seconds after an open-field tackle against a Bengals wide receiver, medical personnel rushed onto the field and administered CPR quickly – which helped save his life.

Hamlin’s heart had stopped, and medical responders revived it twice before putting him into an ambulance and taking him to the hospital. The immediate actions of medical personnel were vital to “not just saving his life, but his neurological function,” said Pritts.
The horrifying scene of Hamlin suddenly falling on his back after standing up following the tackle unsettled his teammates, the other players and millions of watching fans.
The game was initially postponed and later cancelled by the NFL – a decision several former football players said was a sign of a shift in prioritizing players’ mental and physical health.
Now, the Bills organization is encouraging people to learn the critical, life-saving skill of administering CPR.
The team has pledged support for resources including CPR certifications, automated external defibrillator units and guidance for developing cardiac emergency response plans within the Buffalo community, according to the statement. “We encourage all our fans to continue showing your support and take the next step by obtaining CPR certification,” the Bills said.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/football/pele-new-york-cosmos-north-america-revolution-spt-intl/index.html,Pelé: Brazilian’s final hurrah at New York Cosmos helped spark ‘sporting revolution’,,,,CNN,"He’d won three World Cups, scored goals galore and become a global icon, but Pelé wasn’t quite done yet, so off he went to the US and helped transform the sport of soccer in North America.
The Brazilian great was convinced to come out of retirement, signing in 1975 for the New York Cosmos for three more seasons.
Pelé had seemingly played his last professional game months prior to joining the North American Soccer League (NASL) side, hanging up his boots after making 638 appearances for his childhood club Santos.
It was almost unfathomable that Pelé would ever play for any other club apart from Santos, but he joined the Cosmos midway through the 1975 season on a $1.67-million-a-year contract, despite soccer struggling to generate much interest in North America at the time.
Pelé came, saw and conquered and by the time ‘ O Rei’ (“The King”) left in 1977, he was an NASL champion who had helped spark a soccer boom.
“During three seasons with the Cosmos, Pelé helped transform the domestic landscape of the sport of soccer,” the Cosmos said in a statement after his death this week.
“Where once there had been baseball diamonds, now there were also soccer pitches.
“The Cosmos and their King not only started a sporting revolution in America, they also traveled the world to spread the Gospel of the Beautiful Game.”
Even now, after almost 50 years, Pelé’s influence is still being felt across both the men’s and women’s games in North America.
His move to Cosmos paved the way for other greats, such as Giorgio Chinaglia and Franz Beckenbauer, to follow suit and although the NASL ultimately folded in 1984, it set a blueprint for Major League Soccer (MLS) when it was established in 1993.
Superstars such as David Beckham, Gareth Bale, Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic have all followed in the footsteps of Pelé by helping grow the sport in North America by playing in the MLS.
Soccer in the US is now thriving, with the US National Men’s Team impressing during the Qatar 2022 World Cup.
Scouts from across the world are now looking at North America to discover new talent, with the sport cemented into the fabric of society and being naturally passed down through generations.
Much of the early work was done in the 1970s thanks to Pelé’s natural ability and infectious smile.
CNN’s Don Riddell spoke with supporters about Pelé during Qatar 2022, with one American saying the legend changed his life.
“Watching him was the first professional game I ever saw in 1975 and because of that, one of the reasons this is my 11th World Cup,” Clifton Broumand told CNN.
“Watching him and his ability hooked me to coming and watching soccer and the World Cup.”
In the season before Pelé joined Santos in 1975, the Cosmos’ largest attendance for a match was a little over 8,000 people.
During his final and most successful season in 1977, the average crowd was 42,689 for home games, including three occasions when the attendance was over 70,000, according to the Society for American Soccer History .
When Pelé joined the Cosmos he was aged 34 and he went on to score a total of 37 goals in 64 NASL matches.
“Pelé’s decision to bring his artistry to the United States with the New York Cosmos in the 1970s was a transformative moment for the sport in this country,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement.
“As Pelé captivated fans throughout the US and Canada, it demonstrated the power of the game and the limitless possibilities for the sport.”
The Cosmos’ first General Manager Clive Toye played a key role in getting the sport’s then biggest superstar to join the Cosmos.
A former journalist who was heavily involved in the NASL’s creation, Toye had a vision for the future of soccer in the US and believed Pelé was the man to make that dream a reality.
However, Toye and the Cosmos faced some stiff opposition from around the world for Pelé’s signature.
Heavyweight political intervention was even brought to bear, with Pelé saying then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had helped convince him to join the Cosmos.
“At that time, I had a lot of proposals to play in England, Italy, Spain, Mexico but I said no. After 18 years, I want to rest because I’m going to retire,” Pelé told CNN in 2011.
“Then appeared the proposal to go to New York because they want to make soccer big in the United States. That was the reason. I started my mission.”
Suddenly it was cool to watch soccer.
Matches were broadcast globally and the star-studded Cosmos team was the hottest ticket in town. The Comsos and Pelé even began touring around the world.
“No matter where we went, all around the world, Asia, Australia, Europe, all they wanted was Pelé,” former Cosmos player Dennis Tueart, who was signed to replace Pelé, though he played some exhibition matches with the Brazilian star, told Sky Sports.
“He had extraordinary vision, extraordinary athleticism […] he was without doubt, in my view, the best.”
Pelé still has a presence in New York City today. The ‘Pelé Soccer’ store was opened in 2019 and sits on the iconic Times Square, a location many fans flocked to after news of his death.
After the Cosmos won the NASL title in 1977, a farewell match against Pelé’s former team Santos was organized, with the Brazilian playing a half for both sides in what would be his final official game.
After the testimonial, he addressed more than 70,000 people inside a packed New York’s Giants Stadium, leading the crowd in a chant of “Love, love, love.”
A fitting end, perhaps, for a man who spread joy wherever he went and who helped establish soccer as a way of life in North America."

He was that rarity; like Muhammad Ali, Pelé was a sports star, who transcended his sport.

The Brazilian brought joy and creativity to a sport often stuck in rigidity and personified o jogo bonito – “the beautiful game.”
“Pele changed everything,” wrote current Brazil international Neymar Jr. after Pelé’s death was announced.
“He turned football into art, into entertainment. He gave a voice to the poor, to Black people and especially. He gave visibility to Brazil.”
From dazzling as a 17-year-old in 1958 on his way to his first World Cup success to claiming the Golden Ball award as player of the 1970 World Cup as he won a third global title, “ O Rei ” (“The King”) achieved almost everything possible in the famous yellow and blue of Brazil.
And there were goals – lots of them.
Pelé scored 757 goals in 812 official matches for club and country. However, there is disagreement over just how many goals he scored in his career. According to Reuters, Brazil’s football association and Santos say Pelé scored 1,283 goals in 1,367 matches, though FIFA puts the number at 1,281 goals in 1,366 games.
But it wasn’t just the phenomenal number of goals he scored. As Neymar suggests, Pelé was also an artist on the pitch.
“Even if he did not use a brush, or a pen, but simply had a ball at his feet,” says CNN Sport’s Don Riddell.
The world first got a glimpse of Pelé at the 1958 World Cup.
“When we arrived in Sweden, no one knew what Brazil was. They know about Argentina … Uruguay. It was a surprise for us,” Pelé told CNN in 2016.
At the age of 17 years and seven months, Pelé became the youngest person to play in a World Cup, a record the Brazilian held until Northern Ireland’s Norman Whiteside took that landmark in 1982.
Almost 15 years after leaving the world agog at the 1958 World Cup, Pelé hung up his boots for the Seleção , bequeathing his nation the legacy as the most successful in World Cup history and the most feared team in international football.
Pelé’s crowning moment for Brazil came at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, a tournament further romanticized by being the first World Cup broadcast in color.
Throughout that tournament, Pelé blazed a trail of technicolor splendor, a blur of yellow and gold, beguiling and bewitching opposition teams.
His four goals earned him player of the tournament, capped by an assist to Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the final against Italy.
“We won the World Cup, and I think in my life in sport (that was the pinnacle), no doubt,” Pelé told CNN.
Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich summed up Pelé’s superhuman genuis fittingly: “I told myself before the game, he’s made of skin and bones just like everyone else. But I was wrong.”
Even moments when Pelé didn’t score helped cement his legend status – notably England goalkeeper Gordon Banks’ incredible block from the Brazilian’s powerful header in a group game, which is widely considered to be the greatest save of all time.
“The save was one of the best I have ever seen – in real life and in all the thousands of games I have watched since,” wrote Pelé in a 2019 Facebook post in tribute to Banks following the goalkeeper’s death.
“When you are a footballer, you know straight away how well you have hit the ball. I hit that header exactly as I had hoped. Exactly where I wanted it to go. And I was ready to celebrate.
“But then this man, Banks, appeared in my sight, like a kind of blue phantom.”

Despite playing all but three years of his club career with Brazilian side Santos, Pelé’s dynamism, majesty with the ball and lethality in front of goal ensured he became one of football’s first Black global stars.
Pelé admitted to CNN in 2015 that he had plenty of interest from Europe to make the move across the Atlantic, but chose not to out of loyalty and “love” for Santos; yet another reason why he is so beloved in his native country.

“In the past, it was a profession filled with love, now it’s just a profession,” Pelé said .
“There isn’t that love of playing for my club, playing for my country. Clearly, a footballer needs to make a living from the game. It’s different from my time.”
Such was his impact as a soccer player, Pelé also became the symbol of a new country, according to a recent Neflix documentary.
“To cope with that, I think he creates this Pelé character, someone who almost kind of forgoes his own identity to become Brazil essentially,” Ben Nicholas, co-director of the documentary about the Brazilian’s life, told CNN .
As well as shouldering the burden of a country’s aspirations on the world stage, the ascension of the Brazilian military in 1964 that showed interest in football as a tactical and political strategy – in particular, targeting the 1970 World Cup as a “government issue” – presented a problem for the apolitical Pelé, according to the Netflix documentary.
“There’s a really telling line at the end of the film,” the other director of the documentary, David Tryhorn, said , “where you’re expecting Pelé to give us perhaps a ‘Pelé-ism,’ where he would talk about joy and happiness, but he actually talks about ‘relief.’”
The footballing GOAT debate is one which will rage on until the end of time – is it Pelé? Or is it Diego Maradona ? Or Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo?
But, Brazil’s pure love and adoration for Pelé cannot be matched and is one which extends further than just an excellent footballer, but to a totem pole for a nation."

Pelé, the Brazilian soccer star who became a global icon, has died at the age of 82 .
Pelé, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, is the only man in history to win three World Cups.
He was just 17 years old when he starred in the 1958 World Cup, scoring two goals in the final over Sweden. He would go on to add titles in 1962 and 1970, thrilling fans with his extraordinary dribbling skills and his prolific goalscoring ability.
For much of his career, Pelé played professionally for the Brazilian club Santos. In the last few years before his retirement, he signed a multimillion-dollar deal to play in the North American Soccer League, where he won a title with the New York Cosmos.
In 2000, FIFA named him Player of the Century along with Argentine great Diego Maradona. Many still consider him the greatest player of all time.
""I was born to play football, just like Beethoven was born to write music and Michelangelo was born to paint,"" Pelé once said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/12/sport/iranian-chess-referee-shohreh-bayat-russia-spt-intl/index.html,Shohreh Bayat: Iranian chess referee fears ostracism over her activism as she challenges Russian chief of game’s governing body FIDE,,,,CNN,"Three years after fleeing Iran, chess referee Shohreh Bayat fears being further ostracized after challenging the game’s governing body and its president, Russia’s former deputy prime minister, over her choice of clothing at a tournament in October.
Back in 2020, Bayat was criticized in Iran for not wearing the appropriate headscarf at the Women’s World Chess Championship in China and Russia. She refused to bow to the regime’s pressure but, as a result, has not returned home out of fear of punishment.
Now, three years on, Bayat has raised the hackles of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and its president for wearing clothes in support of the Iranian protests and the people of Ukraine.
The 35-year-old Bayat, who now lives in London with her husband, recently officiated at the 2022 Fischer Random World Chess Championship in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October.
The tournament was another opportunity for Bayat to officiate some of the sport’s biggest stars, though it came at a difficult time as protests spread across her home country of Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini .
The 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman died in mid-September after being detained by the country’s morality police, allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code, sparking outrage around a range of grievances with the regime.
“It reminded me of my own story,” Bayat told CNN. “So I decided to stand up for women’s rights in Iran. During the tournament I wore a t-shirt with the motto of Iranian people ‘WomanLifeFreedom’ and I wanted to stand with them.”

Bayat said that after the first day of wearing the t-shirt, a FIDE official asked her, unofficially, to not wear it.
In a statement sent to CNN, FIDE said that “arbiters at top events are required to dress in due decor and discretion” and that Bayat “disregarded direct instructions given to her to stop wearing slogans or mottos.”
According to Bayat, such regulations are not found in FIDE’s arbiter handbook and she says no dress code was given for the event in Iceland.
The arbiter’s handbook does say officials must “follow the dress code” and that they must be “dressed properly, helping to improve the image of chess as a sport.” CNN has reached out to FIDE to clarify the dress code that was expected for the October event.
Frustrated by the request to stop wearing the slogan, Bayat said she decided she was not breaking any rules so she wore it again the next day.
Bayat says she was once again asked by an official to take it off, only this time she was told the request came from FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich, who previously served as Russia’s deputy prime minister and who attended the tournament in Iceland.
Bayat said Dvorkovich never spoke to her in person about the t-shirt, despite being in the same room as her when she wore it.
Dvorkovich, however, messaged her on WhatsApp – messages seen by CNN – to request Bayat not use official FIDE events for “political purposes.”
Angered by Dvorkovich’s request, Bayat says she quickly responded but then deleted her “emotional” reply.
Bayat then informed Dvorkovich she would not wear the t-shirt the next day, though she wanted to do the “right thing.”
Given that FIDE’s charter states that it is “committed to respecting all internationally recognized human rights and shall strive to promote the protection of these rights,” Bayat said she decided she had not violated any rule.
“I thought carefully, and I realized that it is not me that was making chess political but Arkady,” Bayat said.
“I was following FIDE rules, but Arkady was breaking them by forbidding me to stand up for women’s rights in Iran.”
FIDE refuted any notion that politics played a part in Dvorkovich’s request to Bayat.
“We were not judging her views or her activism, but the platform and moment she chose for it,” FIDE told CNN.
The following day, Bayat, who has not seen her parents since leaving Iran over three years ago, said she bought a blue and yellow outfit and wore it in support of the Ukrainian people fighting against the Russian invasion, and also in memory of the 176 people that were killed when Iran said it unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian plane that crashed near Tehran in 2020.
She says nothing was said to her about the blue and yellow outfit but, since leaving the tournament in Iceland, Bayat told CNN that she hasn’t been invited to another FIDE event, despite the organization recognizing her as the best female arbiter in Europe in 2022.
Bayat said she was initially removed from the arbiter commission – a registry of all qualified arbiters – and, in a message seen by CNN, a top FIDE official told her it was because of her outfits in Iceland.
Her name is currently listed on the database and FIDE told CNN that Bayat was still very much in contention to officiate future events but that it has “more International Arbiters than world events, so we need to establish some rotation.”
FIDE President Dvorkovich was first elected in 2018 and was re-elected for a second term in August. Previously, the 50-year-old served as Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister between 2012-2018 following a stint as the Kremlin’s top economic adviser.
The Kremlin welcomed Dvorkovich being reelected as FIDE president last year, but he has always maintained his proximity to the Kremlin would not impact his work for FIDE and noted that he was one of the most senior establishment figures in Russia to question the war in Ukraine.
However, Bayat told CNN she believes Dvorkovich is not accepting criticism of Iran due to Russia’s links with the country – Iran continues to support Russia with military aid for the war in Ukraine.
She notes FIDE’s handling of the Iranian Chess Federation as further evidence of this.
Dvorkovich wrote a letter urging Iran to comply with FIDE’s regulations in 2020 after it allegedly told its players to not play against Israeli opponents.
The acting president of Iran’s Chess Federation responded, saying that Iran has constantly been in compliance with FIDE’s rules and statutes, and that the athletes themselves decide in which events to participate.

Despite being given a warning, Iranian players are still forfeiting games and FIDE has not yet taken concrete action.
“I find it extremely ironic that FIDE finds my human rights t-shirt political, but when the Iran Chess Federation repeatedly forces its players not to play against Israel, FIDE is silent and turns a blind eye to that,” Bayat said.
Asked by CNN whether it was confident Dvorkovich was working without pressure from Russian authorities in regards to Bayat’s support of the Iranian protests, FIDE said it had total and absolute faith in him.
“While we respect Ms. Bayat’s political stance and activities, any FIDE officials need to follow political neutrality while on duty, and of all the official positions one can hold, that of an arbiter is the one that demands higher standards of integrity, neutrality, and discretion,” FIDE said in a statement to CNN.
“No matter how noble or uncontroversial the cause is, doing activism from that role is inappropriate and unprofessional. She was indeed asked not to wear any slogans while acting as an arbiter and explained the reasons why.”
Bayat’s activism has attracted the attention of the biggest names in the sport after the Iranian chess referee tweeted about the incident again on Sunday.
US grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura recently tweeted “#WomenLifeFreedom #IStandWithUkraine” in response to a message about Bayat’s tweet .
Meanwhile, chess superstar Magnus Carlsen’s coach Peter Heine Nielsen tweeted : “The chess world needs to make up its mind. On which side do we actually stand?”
Bayat, who now also works in primary schools teaching chess, said the support she’s received has been “heartwarming,” as it was when she first sought asylum in England back in 2020.
“I was initially trying to support Iranian women. I think that’s important and it’s very nice to see other people are supporting me for doing the right thing,” she said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/sport/nfl-lovie-smith-diversity/index.html,Lovie Smith: NFL is again being criticised about its lack of diversity,,,,CNN,"When Lovie Smith was hired by the Houston Texans in February 2022 as the team’s new head coach, he said the NFL had “a problem” with hiring Black coaches and diversity.
“I realize the amount of Black head coaches there are in the National Football League,” Smith told reporters just under a year ago.
“There’s Mike Tomlin and I think there’s me, I don’t know of many more. So there’s a problem, and it’s obvious for us. And after there’s a problem, what are you going to do about it?”
Smith was fired Monday at the end of his one and only season at the helm of the Texans, finishing with a record of 3-13-1.
Smith is the second Black coach in two years to be relieved of his duties by the Texans, which fired David Culley at the end of the 2021 season.
Smith’s time in charge wasn’t full of wins and high points – though his parting gift to the organization was a last-minute Hail Mary victory over the Indianapolis Colts, which saw them relinquish the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NFL draft to the Chicago Bears. But his Texans team showed togetherness and competence, traits often desired by outfits undergoing a rebuild.
Houston general manager Nick Caserio said Smith’s firing was the best decision for the team right now.
“On behalf of the entire organization, I would like to thank Lovie Smith for everything he has contributed to our team over the last two seasons as a coach and a leader,” Caserio said in a statement.
“I’m constantly evaluating our football operation and believe this is the best decision for us at this time. It is my responsibility to build a comprehensive and competitive program that can sustain success over a long period of time. We aren’t there right now, however, with the support of the McNair family and the resources available to us, I’m confident in the direction of our football program moving forward.”

But the firing of the 64-year-old coach, the Texans organization as a whole, and the measures implemented by the league to promote diversity have been heavily criticized by former players and TV pundits.
“The Houston Texans have fired Lovie Smith after 1 year. Using 2 Black Head Coaches to tank and then firing them after 1 year shouldn’t sit right with anyone,” former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III tweeted Sunday , when news of Smith’s firing broke.
On ESPN, Stephen A. Smith and NFL Hall of Famer Michael Irvin also condemned the decision . Smith called the Texans organization an “atrocity.”
“They are an embarrassment. And as far as I’m concerned, if you’re an African American, and you aspire to be a head coach in the National Football League, there are 31 teams you should hope for. You should hope beyond God that the Houston Texans never call you,” Smith said.
Irvin said Black coaches are being used as “scapegoats” by the Texans.
“It’s a mess in Houston and they bring these guys in and they use them as scapegoats. And this is what African American coaches have been yelling about for a while and it’s blatant, right in our face,” he said.
When CNN contacted the Texans for comment, the team highlighted the moment at Monday’s news conference when Caserio was asked why any Black coach would consider working for the team, and his response was that individual candidates would have to make their own choices.
“In the end it’s not about race. It’s about finding quality coaches,” the general manager said. “There’s a lot of quality coaches. David (Culley) is a quality coach. Lovie (Smith) is a quality coach.
“In the end, each coach has their own beliefs. Each coach has their own philosophy. Each coach has their comfort level about what we’re doing. That’s all I can do is just be honest and forthright, which I’ve done from the day that I took this job, and I’m going to continue to do that and try to find a coach that we feel makes the most sense for this organization. That’s the simplest way I can answer it, and that’s my commitment.
“That’s what I’m hired to do, and that’s what I’m in the position to do. At some point, if somebody feels that that’s not the right decision for this organization, then I have to respect that, and I have to accept it.”
CNN has reached out to Lovie Smith for comment.
At the beginning of the 2022 season, NFL.com reported Smith was one one of just six minority head coaches in the NFL, a low number in a league where nearly 70% of the players are Black.

Since Art Shell was hired by the Los Angeles Raiders in 1989 as the first Black head coach in modern history, there have been 191 people hired as head coaches, but just 24 have been Black.
However, the NFL has taken steps to increase diversity in the coaching ranks.
Notably, in 2003, the NFL introduced the Rooney Rule to improve hiring practices in a bid to “increase the number of minorities hired in head coach, general manager, and executive positions.”
But the Rooney Rule hasn’t been an unqualified success.
In 2003, the Detroit Lions were fined $200,000 for not interviewing any minority coaches before hiring Steve Mariucci as their new head coach.
In response to criticism, the NFL announced it was setting up a diversity advisory committee of outside experts to review its hiring practices last March. Teams would also be required to hire minority coaches as offensive assistants.
Despite changes to the rule being implemented in recent years to strengthen it, a 2022 lawsuit alleges that some teams have implemented “sham” interviews to fulfill the league’s diversity requirements.
Last February, former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores filed a federal civil lawsuit against the NFL, the New York Giants, the Denver Broncos and the Miami Dolphins organizations alleging racial discrimination.
Flores, who is Black, said in his lawsuit that the Giants interviewed him for their vacant head coaching job under disingenuous circumstances.
Two months after submitting the initial lawsuit, Flores added the Texans to it, alleging the organization declined to hire him this offseason as head coach “due to his decision to file this action and speak publicly about systemic discrimination in the NFL.”
In response to the lawsuit, the Texans said their “search for our head coach was very thorough and inclusive.”
The NFL called Flores’ allegations meritless.
“The NFL and our clubs are deeply committed to ensuring equitable employment practices and continue to make progress in providing equitable opportunities throughout our organizations,” the league said in response to the lawsuit.
“Diversity is core to everything we do, and there are few issues on which our clubs and our internal leadership team spend more time. We will defend against these claims, which are without merit.”
But 12 months after firing their last Black head coach, the Texans have fired another one.
“How do you hire two African Americans, leave them one year and then get rid them?” questioned NFL Hall of Famer Irvin .
“You know the mess that Houston is,” Irvin added. “We get the worst jobs and we don’t get the opportunity to fix the worst jobs, just like this.
“I don’t know any great White coach that would take the (Texans) job unless you give them some guarantees. ‘You’re going to have to guarantee me four years to turn this place around.’ But the African American coaches can’t come in with that power because Lovie wouldn’t have got another job.
“This was his last chance to get back into the NFL and you have to take what’s on the table to try to change that.”
The Texans are now searching for a new head coach under general manager Caserio. The new appointment will be Caserio’s third coach in the role: It is almost unprecedented for a general manager to get the opportunity to hire a third head coach with the same team.
Texans chairman and CEO Cal McNair said he would take on a more active role in the hiring process. The next head coach will be the organization’s fourth in three years .
According to the NFL, the Texans have requested to speak to five candidates already about filling Smith’s position, a list that includes two Black coaches.
After Smith was hired in March 2021, McNair said: “I’ve never seen a more thorough, inclusive, and in-depth process than what Nick (Caserio) just went through with our coaching search.”
At that introductory news conference, Smith spoke candidly about how to bring greater diversity to the NFL coaching ranks.
“People in positions of authority throughout – head coaches, general managers – you’ve got to be deliberate about trying to get more Black athletes in some of the quality control positions just throughout your program. If you get that, they can move up, that’s one way to get more.”
Smith continued: “It’s not just an interview, if you’re interviewing a Black guy. It’s about having a whole lot of guys to choose from that look like me. And it’s just not about talk. You look at my staff, that’s what I believe in. And letting those guys show you who they are. That’s how we can increase it, then it’s left up to people to choose. We all have an opportunity to choose, and that’s how I think we’ll get it done.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/sport/maiden-sailing-tracy-edwards-spt-intl/index.html,How pioneering yacht Maiden overcame ‘the real last bastion of male dominance’ and continues to empower women,,,,CNN,"More than three decades since its pioneering, round-the-world voyage, the Maiden racing yacht is again sailing the high seas – and changing the lives of young women in the process.
Skippered by British sailor Tracy Edwards , Maiden became the first all-female crew to sail around the world in 1990 – a landmark moment for a sport that was slow to welcome women into the fold.
“It’s hard to remember that people were pretty aggressive about not wanting us to race around the world,” Edwards tells CNN Sport’s Don Riddell . “It was the real last bastion of male dominance in a sport.”
The crew ended up winning two of the six legs of the Whitbread Round the World Race – now known as the Volvo Ocean Race – and placed second overall in its class, defying the sexist attitudes that pervaded sailing at the time.
“One of the headlines, which has to be my favorite, was: ‘Maiden is just a tin full of tarts,’” says Edwards, adding that the same journalist later referred to the crew as “a tin full of smart, fast tarts.”
Fast forward 33 years ago and Maiden continues to represent “the empowerment of women, the strength of women, and what women are capable of,” according to Edwards.
Having been restored to its former glory, the yacht has been touring around the world since 2018, recently completing a journey from Dakar, Senegal, to Cape Town, South Africa.
The aim of the tour is to raise funds and awareness for girls’ education, trying – particularly in the developing world – to keep them in education until they are 18.
Making Maiden seaworthy once more was no easy feat. In 2014, Edwards was told that the vessel had fallen into disrepair and was rotting away in the Seychelles.
That prompted the original crew from the 1989-90 Whitbread Round the World Race to start a fundraiser. Along with support from Princess Haya Bint al-Hussein, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan, they were able to bring Maiden back to the UK and begin a restoration project.
“The Maiden Factor” – the name given to the not-for-profit organization – forms part of the legacy of the original crew.
Between 2021 and 2024, Maiden intends to sail 90,000 nautical miles, visiting 60 destinations in more than 40 different countries.
“I’m seeing people getting to dream more and understanding that we are limitless as human beings,” says Lungi Mchunu, a member of the current Maiden crew.
“I just want them to be able to dream and know that they can try and do anything. If it doesn’t work for you, that’s fine; you keep moving, you find something that’s more suited for you.”
A South African native, Mchunu used to work as a banker and was terrified of the sea before she discovered sailing in 2017. Since then, she has not only conquered her fear, but has also become the first African woman to sail to the Arctic.
“For some odd reason, I feel at home even when the waves are like five or eight meters,” says Mchunu.
“I feel the most comfortable at sea … Even when I was rescued in the Arctic, it was not scary. I was just okay, I guess … I’m getting to know a side of myself that I never knew existed.”
Mchunu’s ultimate dream is to sail solo around the world, and Maiden – as it has with so many other women before – is empowering her to achieve that goal."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/golf/st-andrews-ladies-putting-club-spt-spc-intl/index.html,"From feminist pioneers to putting pros, the historic journey of the St. Andrews Ladies Putting Club",,,,CNN,"Who would you back to sink a putt to save your life? Tiger Woods ? Jack Nicklaus ? Ben Crenshaw?
There is a plethora of debatable options, but it is unlikely many would look to a group of women in Fife, Scotland , with no professional golfing experience, many of whom are far more mature than the average Tour player.
Yet perhaps they should, because anyone putting their life in the hands of the St. Andrews Ladies Putting Club would be entrusting it to an organization with over 150 years of short game experience.
Established in 1867, the group is the oldest ladies golf club in the world, a title owed to some perseverant, golf-loving women –  and some disgruntled men.
When the daughters of members of the St. Andrews Royal & Ancient (R&A) Club – widely regarded as the historic home of the game – decided they wanted to play golf, it was not a conventional activity for women. Croquet and archery were the traditional choices among the limited options available.
When the women ventured onto the caddy’s putting course, which was used by those manning the members’ golf bags between rounds, the caddies wanted them gone almost immediately.
“They didn’t like it at all, and I don’t think the members liked it very much either,” club archivist Eve Soulsby told CNN’s The Jazzy Golfer.
But the caddies had a problem: As employees of the club, they couldn’t complain to the members. A compromise quickly emerged – to give the women a piece of land next to the iconic Swilcan Bridge that they could use as a nine-hole putting course.
It was a rough area, filled with rabbit holes, divots and sand, but it was a start. One month later, 22 women competed at the St. Andrews Ladies Golf Club’s inaugural tournament.
The word quickly spread. By the late 1880s,  the membership had grown to 600, including male associate members. Today, there is an ever-growing waiting list to join the 140-strong membership, a number kept low to ensure tournaments run smoothly.
Soon after, Old Tom Morris, the course’s resident player, and greenkeeper, often referred to as the “founding father of golf,” decided it would be a good idea for the ladies to visit the nearby Himalaya section of the course, so named because of its hilly topography.
Morris prepared the area for the club before retiring in 1895, when he was made an honorary member.
Related article Scotland recognized as world's best golf destination
Soulsby believes the club’s early members played a pivotal role in gaining more independence for the women of St. Andrews towards the turn of the century, citing the creation of the women’s course, which – alongside the Himalaya’s putting course – remains playable to this day.
Income raised from visitors to the putting course is donated to local charities, with an exception made last year to give funds to Ukrainian organizations.
Officially named The Jubilee Course and opened in 1897, the fact that the women’s designated 18 holes was coined “The Duffers Course” reflected commonly held attitudes towards women during the period. “We pretend that didn’t happen,” Soulsby added.
Among those carrying the torch for those early pioneers today is Sylvia Dunne, the club’s current president.
A member since 2011, Dunne helps organize the group’s weekly tournaments; a showpiece two-round event on Wednesday afternoons and a one-round competition on Thursday morning for the so-called “oldies” who may struggle to manage multiple rounds.
“It’s the camaraderie and everything too, because if you get older and you can’t play golf, you could be just stuck at home doing nothing all day, and this is really a very social club,” she said.
“The best part is the afterwards because they have coffee and biscuits and a blither.”
Members who won tournaments in the early 20th century may have been lucky enough to take home a royal prize. The club’s first regal donation came from Prince Leopold, youngest son of Queen Victoria, and other trophies later followed from Edward VIII and King George VI.

At one time, R&A captains also donated trophies, but now they face off against the Ladies Putting Club in an annual 18 vs 18 putting competition.
Dunne is one of the most prolific putters at the club, sweeping six trophies in a single season during her best year. However, she admits the putting green can be a cruel mistress, even for her.
“One day recently I was so exasperated,” she said. “We have a prize at the end of the season for the most holes in one – so I suggested, isn’t it time we had a prize for the most near misses?
“There is a lot of skill involved, but there’s also a lot of luck. Some days the ball rolls for you and other days it will not drop in the hole.”"

The world No. 5 even bogeyed Sunday’s first hole but went on a remarkable run to finish the final round with a 10-under-par 63.
Rahm ended the tournament 27-under-par to beat two-time major winner Collin Morikawa by two shots.

Morikawa went into Sunday’s final round with a six-shot lead over the chasing pack, but three bogeys on the back nine gave him a one-under-par 72 and allowed Rahm to claw back the deficit.
“I needed to play good and he needed to make a couple mistakes,” Rahm said, per the BBC.
“If you told me at the beginning of the round after that bogey I was going to do what I did, I don’t know if I would have believed you.”
It was the eighth PGA Tour win of Rahm’s career and the 28-year-old will go down as the winner of the Tour’s first “designated” event with an elevated purse, introduced in a bid to compete with LIV Golf’s rise.
It is the first of 17 events this season – including the four majors – that will have the designated event tag, with a total purse of $15 million and Rahm earning $2.7 million for his victory.
Most of the remaining designated tournaments will have total purses of at least $20 million, with the PLAYERS Championship boasting an eye-watering $25 million purse.
While Sunday proved to be a day of delight for Rahm, Morikawa was left disappointed and frustrated with his final round performance, despite scooping up $1.5 million for his second-place finish.
“You work so hard and you give yourself these opportunities,” 2021 Open winner Morikawa said, per the BBC.
“I just made three poor swings, really, at the wrong times. It’s never a good time to put a poor swing on it, but sometimes, it works out and these never worked out.
“I don’t know what I’m going to learn from this week, but it just didn’t seem like it was that far off. It really wasn’t. Yeah, it sucks.”"

Sign up here .
It’s a partnership that’s been hailed as “ history in the making .”
One of the world’s most famous soccer stars landed in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday, where Cristiano Ronaldo was received in an extravagant ceremony, with excited children sporting his new club’s yellow and blue jerseys.
Oil-rich Saudi Arabia’s success in luring the five-time Ballon d’Or winner on a two-year contract with the kingdom’s Al Nassr FC is the Gulf monarchy’s latest step in realizing its sporting ambitions – seemingly at any cost.
According to Saudi state-owned media, Ronaldo will earn an estimated $200 million a year with Al Nassr, making him the world’s highest-paid soccer player.
Shortly after the 37-year-old’s signing with Al Nassr, the club’s Instagram page gained over 5.3 million new followers . Its official website was inaccessible after exceeding its bandwidth limit due to the sudden surge in traffic, and the hashtag #HalaRonaldo – Hello, Ronaldo in Arabic – was trending for days across the Middle East on Twitter.
Analysts say that his recruitment in Saudi Arabia is part of a wider effort by the kingdom to diversify its sources of revenue and become a serious player in the international sporting scene.
It is also seen as a move by the kingdom to shore up its image after it was tarnished by the 2018 dismemberment and killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents, and a devastating war it started in Yemen in 2015.
Critics have decried the kingdom for “ sportswashing ,” an attempt to burnish one’s reputation through sport.
“I think Saudi Arabia has recognized a couple of years ago that to be a powerful nation internationally, you cannot just rely on hard power ,” Danyel Reiche, a visiting research fellow and associate professor at Georgetown University Qatar, told CNN.
“You also need to invest in soft power, and the case of Qatar shows that this can work pretty well,” he said, adding that Saudi Arabia is following in the Qatari approach with sport, but with a delay of around 25 years.

Neighboring Qatar has also faced immense criticism since it won the bid to hosting last year’s FIFA World Cup in 2010.
Despite the smaller Gulf state facing similar accusations of “sportswashing,” the tournament has largely been viewed as a success, not least in exposing the world to a different view of the Middle East, thanks in part to Morocco’s success in reaching the semifinals and Saudi Arabia beating eventual World Cup champion Argentina in their opening group game.
Gulf nations engage in fierce competition to become the region’s premier entertainment and sporting hubs. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain, in close proximity to each other, each have their own Formula One racing event. But their competition hasn’t been confined to the region. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also bought trophy European soccer teams.
Riyadh is playing catchup with neighbors who have long realized the importance of investing in sports, said Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School in Lille, France, especially as its main source of income – oil – is being gradually shunned.
“This is part of an ongoing attempt to create more resilient economies that are more broadly based upon industries other than those that are derived from oil and gas,” Chadwick told CNN.
Ronaldo’s new club Al Nassr is backed by Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC), a subsidiary of the kingdom’s wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has played a pivotal role in Saudi Arabia’s diversification plans.

“It is also a sign of interconnectedness, of globalization and of opening up to the rest of the world,” said Georgetown University’s Reiche.
The move is part of “several recent high profile moves in the sports world, including hosting the Andy Ruiz Jr. and Anthony Joshua world heavywight boxing championship bout in 2019, and launching the LIV Golf championship ,” said Omar Al-Ubaydli, director of research at the Bahrain-based Derasat think tank. “It is a significant piece of a large puzzle that represents their economic restructuring.”
The kingdom has been on a path to not only diversify its economy, but also shift its image amid a barrage of criticism over its human rights record and treatment of women. Saudi Arabia is today hosting everything from desert raves to teaming up with renowned soccer players. Argentina’s Lionel Messi last year signed a lucrative promotional deal with the kingdom.
Hailed as the world’s greatest player, 35-year-old Messi ended this year’s World Cup tournament in Qatar with his team’s win over France, making his ambassadorship of even greater value to the kingdom.
The acquisition of such key global figures will also help combat the monarchy’s decades-long reputation of being “secretive” and “ultra-conservative,” James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and an expert on soccer in the Middle East, told CNN’s Eleni Giokos on Wednesday.
Al-Ubaydli said that the kingdom wants to use high profile international sports “as a vehicle for advertising to the world its openness.”

Saudi Arabia bought the English Premier league club Newcastle United in 2021 through a three-party consortium, with PIF being the largest stakeholder. The move proved controversial , as Amnesty International and other human rights defenders worried it would overshadow the kingdom’s human rights violations.
Ronaldo’s work with Saudi Arabia is already being criticized by rights groups who are urging the soccer player to “draw attention to human rights issues” in Saudi Arabia.
“Saudi Arabia has an image problem,” especially since Khashoggi’s killing, says Reiche. But the kingdom’s recent investments in sports and entertainment are “not about sportswashing but about developing the country, social change and opening up to the world.”
Saudi Arabia is reportedly weighing a 2030 World Cup bid with Egypt and Greece, but the kingdom’s tourism ministry noted in November that it has not yet submitted an official bid. Chadwick believes that Ronaldo’s deal with Al Nassr, however, may help boost the kingdom’s bid should it choose it pursue it.
Another way Saudi Arabia may benefit from Ronaldo’s acquisition is that it will be able to improve commercial performance, says Chadwick, especially if this collaboration attracts further international talent.
“It is important to see Ronaldo not just as a geopolitical instrument,” said Chadwick, “There is still a commercial component to him and to the purpose he is expected to serve in Saudi Arabia.”
What Ronaldo’s move to Saudi Arabia shows is that the kingdom aspires “to be seen as being the best” and that it wants to be perceived as a “contender and a legitimate member of the international football community,” said Chadwick.
UAE FM meets Syria’s Assad in Damascus in further sign of thawing ties
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad received the United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed in Damascus on Wednesday in the latest sign of thawing relations between Assad and the Gulf state.

Iran shuts down French cultural center over Charlie Hebdo’s Khamenei cartoons
Iran announced on Thursday it had ended the activities of a Tehran-based French research institute, in reaction to cartoons mocking Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and fellow Shia Muslim clerics published by French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo this week.
The prized legacy of iconic Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum re-emerged this year when Rolling Stone magazine featured her in its “ 200 Greatest Singers of All Time .”
Ranking 61st, Umm Kulthum was the only Arab artist to make it to the list, with the magazine saying that she “has no real equivalent among singers in the West.”
Born in a small village northeast of the Egyptian capital Cairo, Umm Kulthum rose to unmatched fame as she came to represent “the soul of the pan-Arab world,” the music magazine said.
“Her potent contralto, which could blur gender in its lower register, conveyed breathtaking emotional range in complex songs that, across theme and wildly-ornamented variations, could easily last an hour, as she worked crowds like a fiery preacher,” it wrote.
Nicknamed “the lady of Arab singing,” her music featured both classical Arabic poetry as well as colloquial songs still adored by younger generations. Her most famous pieces include “Inta Uumri” (you are my life), “Alf Leila Weileila” (a thousand and one nights), “Amal Hayati” (hope of my life) and “Daret al-Ayyam” (the days have come around). Some of her songs have been remixed to modern beats that have made their way to Middle Eastern nightclubs.
The singer remains an unmatched voice across the Arab World and her music can still be heard in many traditional coffee shops in Old Cairo’s neighborhoods and other parts of the Arab world.
Umm Kulthum’s death in 1975 brought millions of mourners to the streets of Cairo.

“Barcelona investigating magistrate’s court number 15 has opened proceedings for an alleged crime of sexual assault due to a complaint presented by a woman against a football player for events that allegedly occurred at a Barcelona nightclub this past month of December,” the court’s statement reads.
“The matter is in the investigative phase and at this time we do not have more information.”
A spokesperson for the court confirmed to CNN the allegations concern Dani Alves.
CNN reached out to Mexico’s UNAM, Alves’ current club, for comment from the team and player but did not immediately hear back. Alves denies any wrongdoing, per Reuters.
Alves is one of the most decorated football players of his generation, having won domestic titles in Spain, Italy and France. He also won three Champions League titles with Barcelona.
Alves won the Copa America with Brazil in 2007 and 2019. At 39 years old, he became Brazil’s oldest player to feature at the World Cup while appearing for the national team in Qatar when his team played Cameroon."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/11/tennis/naomi-osaka-pregnancy-tennis-spt-intl/index.html,Naomi Osaka: Tennis star announces she is pregnant,,,,CNN,"Tennis star Naomi Osaka announced her pregnancy on Wednesday, posting a photo of an ultrasound scan on her social media accounts.
“The past few years have been interesting to say the least, but I find that it’s the most challenging times in life that may be the most fun,” the four-time major champion wrote alongside the photo.
“These few months away from the sport [have] really given me a new love and appreciation for the game I’ve dedicated my life to.”
Osaka said she plans to return to tennis in 2024 for next year’s Australian Open, a tournament she has won on two previous occasions.

“I know that I have so much to look forward to in the future,” she added. “One thing I’m looking forward to is for my kid to watch one of my matches and tell someone, ‘that’s my mom.’”
The 25-year-old’s withdrawal from the upcoming Australian Open was announced by the competition’s organizers on Sunday.
Osaka has not played since the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo in September last year.
She took some time away from competitive tennis and made several highly publicized disclosures about her struggles with mental health following an incident in August 2021, where she was visibly stressed and emotional while addressing the media during a mandatory news conference at Roland Garros.
Osaka subsequently pulled out of the French Open that year and revealed she had “suffered long bouts of depression” since winning her first major championship in 2018.
“I don’t think there’s a perfectly correct path to take in life but I always felt that if you move forward with good intentions you’ll find your way eventually,” Osaka added in her statement on Wednesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/tech/how-to-spot-fake-misleading-news-trnd/index.html,How to outsmart fake news in your Facebook feed,,,,CNN,"Just because it’s on the internet doesn’t make it true . It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn’t have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn’t breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot – if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.
NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars , an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis , the head of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute.
1. Fake news
Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like “.co” or “.su,” or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales.
Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don’t bother to click through .
Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. “Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to ‘Take Their Business Elsewhere’,” trumpeted one such headline.
However, the articles themselves didn’t contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi’s stock saw a significant drop (it didn’t). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump’s election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to “take their business elsewhere.”
Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney.
A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump’s election win. The story quickly caught fire online – after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry.
It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio – in 2015 .  It had nothing to do with the election results at all.
Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 “bathroom bill” controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. “IT BEGINS,” read the headline.
However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the “bathroom bill” was to be passed.
In fact, according to Snopes , the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy.
It’s not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral.
One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a “clear parasite” was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel .
Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company . Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found – because the story is 100% fake.
A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:
“If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific. ”
This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it : People.com has extensive archives, and this quote is nowhere to be found in them.
During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as “reported” by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as “reported” by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!
In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It’s always good to trace a story back to the original source , and if you find yourself in a loop – or if they all lead back to the same dubious site – you have reason to doubt.
Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook’s algorithm – the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.
Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence.
“We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,” says Zimdars. “If we come into contact with information we don’t agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.”
So if you find an outrageous article that feels “too good to be true,” use caution: It just might be.
Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know you’re getting the real deal . View the whole list here .
This is where things can get tricky . There’s obviously a big difference between “misleading” news, which is usually based in fact, and “fake” news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars’ now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list .
While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as “fake” is not accurate. “I want to make sure this list doesn’t do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,” she says. “It’s interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.”"

Planned Roborace series will see autonomous cars compete at Formula E ePrix weekends
It is a car kitted out with technology its developers boldly predict will transform our cities and change the way we live.
The autonomous “DevBot #1” took a giant leap forward in Morocco recently, making its debut on a street track at the Formula E Marrakech ePrix .
The battery-powered prototype is being tested for Roborace – a proposed race series where driverless cars will compete on temporary city circuits.
“It’s the first time we’ve run the Devbot in driverless mode on a Formula E track in the middle of a city street,” Roborace’s Justin Cooke told CNN.
“It’s so exciting for the team who put hours and hours of work in. These guys were up to 1-2 a.m. in the morning developing a technology that no one else in the world is able to do at this speed and in these complicated environments.”

Using a variety of sensors – including GPS, radar and ultrasonics – allied to sophisticated computer programs, the car learns how to navigate a track at speed avoiding all obstacles.
“What we are doing is at the forefront of technology right now,” says Cooke, who is also CMO of Kinetik – an investment company founded by Russian businessman Denis Sverdlov which is providing financial backing for the project.
“There are two or three kinds of space races, if you will – some people are going to Mars, we’re developing robotic cars and I think it’s probably one of the most, if not the most exciting space in the world right now.”
After the successful 30-minute test in Marrakech – this year’s host city for the United Nations climate change conference (COP22) – Cooke say the company will next try racing two cars together on track with the eventual aim of having up to 10 cars competing at every Formula E ePrix weekend.
“To be here at COP22 when we are celebrating an electric future, a driverless future – it’s the perfect time for Roborace,” Cooke enthuses.

https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/aviation/sports-car-with-wings-icon-a5/index.html,Flying a sports car with wings,,,,CNN,"The intuitive amphibious ICON A5 looks like a sports car
It does require a sports pilot license to fly it
When it comes to piloting a plane, I have zero experience.
In fact, I’ve never even considered attempting it.
Nevertheless, as we swoop over Florida’s Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.
At 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it’s known as a sea light-sport aircraft.
Designed to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there’s nothing else quite like it on the market.
Now that I’m in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I’m not entirely sure.
However, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car.
Plus, the fact that Icon’s CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn’t hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.
So far, so good.
We glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I’m comfortable enough to take in the sights. Lovely Fort De Soto Park doesn’t disappoint.
Squiggles of dreamy white dunes are surrounded by water that looks like it should be in the Caribbean.
The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, with its series of long-spanning cables, is equally impressive.
The adrenaline is still racing. And as most surreal experiences go, it just keeps getting better.
For starters, there’s another ICON A5 to my left, which is thrilling in itself. We are flying in formation, and my job is to mimic its movements. You’d think this would be intimidating, but it’s not.
It’s just plain fun.
That’s music to Hawkins’ ears. He’s the brains behind this newfangled plane, an idea 10 years in the making.
As a former Air Force F-16 pilot and a Stanford Business School grad, he has focused most of his adult life on making sport flying available to the masses.
“The idea for us was to create an airplane where the average human being can go out and experience the world without having the burden of becoming a professional pilot,” he says.
So it makes sense that the dashboard looks like what you see in your car. There are only a few gauges that I don’t recognize.
“It’s the Apple approach to things,” he says. “You humanize it, and make it intuitive and easy and cool.”
He’s so confident people will want to fly (and buy) his planes that he just opened a flight-training facility at Peter O. Knight Airport.
Located on Davis Island, five minutes from downtown Tampa, it’s a place where both beauty and sailboats abound.
The company’s other training center is in Vacaville, California, where ICON is headquartered.
By 9 a.m., it’s time for a brief water-landing pitstop.
Hawkins takes over the controls. I’ve been too busy learning to fly in formation (not something non-pilots get to try very often) and interviewing Hawkins to even think about learning to do a water landing myself. It’s something Hawkins tells me most people can master in about 30 minutes.
A few negative-Gs and 360-degree turns later and it becomes a fun roller-coaster ride in the sky. Plus, it’s an open-air flight, so I occasionally flop my arms out. Just because I can.
At a few hundred feet above the water, it’s easy to spot a boater waving at us, a flock of pelicans and even stingrays.
“We’re gonna pull over here and stop and get out for a second,” he says.
Surely he’s kidding, right? But after landing the plane on the water, he takes off his seatbelt, and I realize he’s not.
Sky pioneers: A light aircraft revolution is taking off
Seconds later, he pops the roof and we climb onto the wings, which could easily double as diving boards. Suddenly, this feels less like a plane outing and more like I’m on a boat sunbathing.
Everything is drenched in a mesmerizing golden hue. I can imagine picnicking on the beach nearby. Or taking the plane somewhere for a remote weekend camping trip.
Because the plane has a range of about 430 miles on a full tank, it’s made for short getaways.
“This entire thing is about inspiring people,” he explains. “Once you learn to fly, you will never be the same. You will look at the sky different, you will look at the planet different.”
“The primary motor skills for operating a plane are pretty easy,” Hawkins tells me. “We have people landing by themselves with an instructor on their very first day, within 30 minutes.”
That said, they’ve painstakingly taken the time to design it for safety. The goal of the spin-resistant airframe feature is that if the pilot makes mistakes, the airplane doesn’t lose control.
As a backup, there’s a complete airplane parachute.
“The spin resistance feature is a big deal as it’s the first airplane that the FAA has deemed spin-resistant,” says Chris Dupin, a flight instructor and US Air Force officer. “A significant number of general aviation fatalities are from loss of control accidents that involve an unrecovered spin on the base to final turn.”
Plus, there’s the angle of attack indicator, something you don’t typically see in a light aircraft. It shows you where the wing is happy (in the green) or where it could stall (in the red).
The pilot’s job is to keep the wing within the green or yellow section of the gauge. This is part of what makes water takeoffs and landings so easy to learn.
“Kirk Hawkins has an extremely creative and innovative idea for pilot training that is more intuitive; teaching the feel of flight first and the principals and structure later, not unlike how people learn to drive,” says Christine Negroni, veteran aviation journalist and author of “The Crash Detectives.”
“The world is facing a pilot shortage, so the idea of teaching differently, so that different learning styles can be accommodated could very well expand the pool of pilot candidates.”
On that note, about 40% of the folks who’ve put down deposits for the ICON A5 are not pilots, which means this plane is drawing aviation newbies.
After an hour and a half of flying time, Hawkins lands us on the airport runway, a maneuver that you can tackle after you’ve mastered several water landings. It’s a bit trickier since it requires more precision and knowledge about crosswinds.
At this point, if I owned this plane, I’d hook it up to a trailer, fold the wings up, drive it home, and park it in the garage.
If you want your own ICON A5, get in line. More than 1,800 customers have put deposits down.
For those who aren’t ready to shell out $207,000 to buy one, there’s the option of stopping by ICON’s training facility in Tampa, or the facility in Vacaville, California, to fly for the day.
The Sport Flying Introduction class is 1.5 hours for $595. To snag your Sport Pilot License, you will need to spend 20-plus hours and pricing varies.

https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/15/tech/girls-design-africa-space-satellite/index.html,Girls to design Africa’s first private space satellite,,,,CNN,"Africa will launch its first private satellite into space
It's been built by schoolgirls
They may be teenagers, but 17-year-old Brittany Bull and 16-year-old Sesam Mngqengqiswa have grand ambitions – to launch Africa’s first private satellite into space in 2019.
They are part of a team of high school girls from Cape Town, South Africa, who have designed and built payloads for a satellite that will orbit over the earth’s poles scanning Africa’s surface.
Once in space, the satellite will collect information on agriculture, and food security within the continent.
Using the data transmitted, “we can try to determine and predict the problems Africa will be facing in the future”, explains Bull, a student at Pelican Park High School.
“Where our food is growing, where we can plant more trees and vegetation and also how we can monitor remote areas,” she says. “We have a lot of forest fires and floods but we don’t always get out there in time.”
Information received twice a day will go towards disaster prevention.
It’s part of a project by South Africa’s Meta Economic Development Organization (MEDO) working with Morehead State University in the US.
The girls (14 in total) are being trained by satellite engineers from Cape Peninsula University of Technology, in a bid to encourage more African women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics).
If the launch is successful, it will make MEDO the first private company in Africa to build a satellite and send it into orbit.
“We expect to receive a good signal, which will allow us to receive reliable data,” declares an enthusiastic Mngqengqiswa, of Philippi High School. “In South Africa we have experienced some of the worst floods and droughts and it has really affected the farmers very badly.”
Drought and environmental effects from climate change have continued to plague the country in recent years. An El Niño induced drought led to a shortfall of 9.3 million tons in southern Africa’s April 2016 maize production, according to a UN report.
“It has caused our economy to drop … This is a way of looking at how we can boost our economy,” says the young Mngqengqiswa.
Initial trials involved the girls programming and launching small CricketSat satellites using high-altitude weather balloons, before eventually helping to configure the satellite payloads.

Small format satellites are low cost ways of gathering data on the planet quickly. Tests so far have involved collecting thermal imaging data which is then interpreted for early flood or drought detection.
“It’s a new field for us [in Africa] but I think with it we would be able to make positive changes to our economy,” says Mngqengqiswa.
Ultimately, it is hoped the project will include girls from Namibia, Malawi, Kenya, and Rwanda.
Mngqengqiswa comes from a single parent household. Her mother is a domestic worker. By becoming a space engineer or astronaut, the teenager hopes to make her mother proud.

More countermeasures involving exercise may help mitigate pain and muscle loss
A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study .
Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission.

Things don’t improve when they return to Earth’s gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc.
“It’s sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,” said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. “So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts’ backs.”
Much attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang’s team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling.

What they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury.
In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren’t using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren’t bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months.

MRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. “Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,” Chang explained.
Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts’ potential time spent in Martian gravity – 38% of the surface gravity on Earth – creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.
The team’s future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.
Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine.
Related article Astronauts ask Congress to take care of their health
In addition to the “fetal tuck” position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done.
“A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit.”
Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station.
Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.
One of Chang’s teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity.
Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.
“When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,” he said. “Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.
“All of them are committed to furthering space knowledge and making incremental steps forward in any way they can for the next crew.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/29/europe/russia-nuclear-drills/index.html,Russian gamers race to prevent nuclear ‘war’,,,,CNN,"Latest craze in Moscow is war game in which players race to find nuclear codes
Russian officials are playing on fears, staging a mass nuclear drill
“Attention! Attention!” blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. “The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.”
Inside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.
Their quest – the latest craze in Moscow – is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general.
It’s complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.
But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.
“I’m worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,” said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.
“I know that normal people all over the world don’t want any war,” he added.
But Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia’s old Cold War rival.
Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack.
The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.
Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.
Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction – or MAD – still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War.
Related article Lithuania issues manual on what to do if Russia invades
But with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real.
“I don’t think nuclear war is likely,” says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs , a prominent foreign policy journal.
“But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don’t have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,” he told CNN.
It is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.
In its flagship current affairs show, Russia’s top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev – dubbed the Kremlin’s propagandist-in-chief by critics – recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.
“Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,” he declared.
Related article Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable conflict
The Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal.
The Satan 2 , as it’s known, will be the world’s most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia’s place as a top nuclear power.
It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow.
“I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,” said  Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer.
“But it sounds ridiculous to me and I’m totally sure that war is impossible,” she adds.
Back in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch.  The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack.
Hopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too."

https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/asia/on-japan---wearable-tech/index.html,What if you could wear a chair?,,,,CNN,"Japan's innovative wearable devices includes Archelis , a ""standing"" chair designed for surgeons.
Tokyo's first Wearable Expo debuted in 2015 and was largest in the world.
Japan's wearable tech market is predicted to grow from 530,000 in 2013 to 13.1 million units in 2017.
What do Discman, Tamagotchi, and Game Boy have in common?
They’re all landmark Japanese inventions from the 80s and 90s, symbols of an era when the Asian nation was a world leader in tech innovation.
But with the rise of Silicon Valley, and American tech giants such as Google and Apple, has seen Japan produce less era-defining tech over the past two decades.
That, says Professor Masahiko Tsukamoto, of Kobe University’s Graduate School of Engineering , is about to change thanks to a new generation of young entrepreneurs, an uptick in international collaborations, and new partnerships with university scientists.
Japan’s focus this time around is not on smart phones or gaming, but wearable chairs, smart glasses and dog communication devices.
In short, wacky wearable tech.
In 2013, Japan sold 530,000 units of wearable tech devices, according to Yano Research Institute .
That figure is predicted to leapfrog to 13.1 million units in 2017.

Perhaps the best indication of the boom in this industry was the introduction of Tokyo’s first Wearable Expo in 2015 – at launch, it was the largest wearable tech fair in the world with 103 exhibitors.
It has featured electronic kimonos, cat communication devices, and electronic gloves to record a pianist’s finger work.
At the next show, from January 18 to 20, 2017, the organizers expect more than 200 exhibitors and 19,000 visitors.
“With better functionality, lighter components and smaller designs, wearing devices is now no longer a fantasy,” says show director Yuhi Maezono. “Wearables are gathering attention as the next big growth market.”
Inupathy is a dog harness slated to launch at the end of this year that will allow pet owners to communicate with their dogs.
As well as a heart monitor, the harness features noise-canceling technology which can isolate the animal’s heartbeat and track its reactions to stimulus, such as food, games, people and toys.
With this data, the harness assesses a dog’s mood and changes color to inform the owners.
Equipped with six LED lights, the collar glows blue to show calm, red for excitement, and displays a rainbow theme for happiness.
Joji Yamaguchi, CEO of Inupathy, was inspired by his Corgi, Akane, who was a nervous puppy. To better understand the dog’s anxiety, the biologist developed Inupathy to monitor his heart rate.

“I always felt like I couldn’t understand Akane very well and I wanted to get be closer to him,” says Yamaguchi.
“Buddhism and old Japanese religion says every animals, plants, and even rocks have spirit inside. It’s stressful when you can’t solve problems that are upsetting them.”
Yamaguchi expects wearable wellness tracking will have applications for humans, too.
“Personalization, of artificial intelligence will be a game-changer,” says Yamaguchi.
“For instance, if you show a certain behavior before you start feeling depressed, predicting your depression from that behavior is extremely valuable for an individual. An AI that works personally for you will eventually make this possible.”
Archelis – a wearable chair launched in Japan this year – is also creating a buzz internationally.
A collaboration between Nitto mold factory, Chiba University, Japan Polymer Technology and Hiroaki Nishimura Design, in Japan, it was initially intended for surgeons, who need to rest their legs during long operations.
The chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.
“The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus’ egg,” says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. “Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain – especially for surgeons who are older.”
Made of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries.
The innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.
The system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.
Though the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet.
Other wearables are on the smaller side.
Measuring about 3 inches long, BIRD is essentially a modern thimble that turns your fingertip into a magic wand.
Using algorithms to decode a user’s intent, the device also features precise sensors that track direction, speed, and gestures.
The technology enables users to turn any surface into a smart screen, as well as interact with other smart devices.
Walking around at home, users can project a laptop screen onto a wall, switch on a coffee machine, read on any surface, and make online purchases with the point or swipe of a finger.
The developers – Israel-based MUV Interactive and Japan-based Silicon Technology – expect BIRD to be embraced by the education and corporate sectors, thanks to its ability to create collaborative presentations."
https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/health/kids-sleep-screens-tech/index.html,Cell phones and screens are keeping your kid awake,,,,CNN,"Devices in the bedroom are associated with children losing sleep time and quality, new research says
Even children and teens who don't stay up late online are losing sleep
These days, teachers often face classrooms filled with yawning students who stayed up late snapping selfies or playing online games.
For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don’t use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.
The analysis found “a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,” said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King’s College London.
Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.
Related article Kids can't sleep? 10 tips that will help
Few parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a “strong and consistent association” between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.
Surprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.
Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was “how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,” many of us will probably recognize our own families’ habits reflected in the statistics.
A large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.
According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children’s sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game.
Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.
Related article How an early bedtime can have lasting effects on kids
Carter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.
“Sleep is vital for children,” said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. “We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more.”
Kansagra, author of “ My Child Won’t Sleep ,” noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. “It’s hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.”
Kansagra said it’s possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. “For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,” he said.
Dr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child’s healthy development, even though “we don’t know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.”
In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. “Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,” said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own “personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.”
Sleep hygiene – tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep – include having a room that is quiet. “And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,” Kline said.
One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation , which recommends at least 30 minutes of “gadget-free transition time” before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.
Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment."
https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/entertainment/kirstie-alley-obit/index.html,"Kirstie Alley, star of ‘Cheers’ and films including ‘Look Who’s Talking,’ dead at 71",,,,CNN,"Actress Kirstie Alley, star of the big and small screens known for her Emmy-winning role on “Cheers” and films like “Look Who’s Talking,” has died after a brief battle with cancer, her children True and Lillie Parker announced on her social media .
She was 71.
“We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away after a battle with cancer, only recently discovered,” the statement read.
“She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead,” the family’s statement continued. “As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother.”
“Our mother’s zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating, were unparalleled and leave us inspired to live life to the fullest just as she did,” the statement said.
A representative for Alley confirmed to CNN via email on Tuesday that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer prior to her death.
A two-time Primetime Emmy Award winner, Alley was born in Wichita, Kansas in 1951.
After a standout role in 1982’s “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” she played roles in movies like 1984’s “Blind Date” and 1987’s “Summer School” opposite Mark Harmon.
That same year, Alley would follow Shelley Long to play the lead opposite Ted Danson in the latter part of TV classic sitcom “Cheers,” which premiered in 1982. Alley first appeared in 1987, playing strong and independent bar manager Rebecca Howe, staying on the acclaimed show until it ended in 1993.
After winning the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series in 1991 for “Cheers” and another for lead actress in a miniseries or special for 1994’s “David’s Mother,” she again found TV success in the late ’90s with series “Veronica’s Closet,” which scored her another Emmy nod.
Additionally, Alley starred in a number of memorable films, like the “Look Who’s Talking” movies, 1990’s “Madhouse” and 1999’s “Drop Dead Gorgeous” with Ellen Barkin.
In 2005, Alley co-wrote and starred in the Showtime comedy “Fat Actress” before making a foray into reality TV.
She appeared in “Kirstie Alley’s Big Life” in 2010, was a contestant on Season 12 of ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” the next year and placed second on Season 22 of the British version of “Celebrity Big Brother” in 2018. In 2022, she competed in Season 7 of Fox’s “The Masked Singer.”
Though she had an impressive body of work, the later part of her career was marked by Alley’s penchant for stirring controversy, especially through social media .
In a 2007 interview, Alley said she was proud of her no holds barred ways.
“I’ve always felt like if someone asks me something, they want the real answer,” Alley told Good Housekeeping.  “I think there’s also something about being from Kansas. Usually people think I’m from New York. The only similarity between New Yorkers and Midwesterners is that what you see is what you get.”
John Travolta, who costarred with Alley in 1989’s hit “Look Who’s Talking” as well as two sequels, wrote on Instagram on Monday, “Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I’ve ever had. I love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.”
Jamie Lee Curtis – who worked with Alley in 2016 on episodes of TV’s “Scream Queens” – shared a statement on Facebook to pay tribute to the late actress, writing, “She was a great comic foil in @tvscreamqueens and a beautiful mama bear in her very real life. She helped me buy onesies for my family that year for Christmas. We agreed to disagree about some things but had a mutual respect and connection. Sad news.”
Josh Gad tweeted, “My heart breaks for Kirstie and her family. Whether it was her brilliance in ‘Cheers; or her magnetic performance in the ‘Look Who’s Talking’ franchise, her smile was always infectious, her laugh was always contagious and her charisma was always iconic. RIP.”
Alley’s “Cheers” co-star Ted Danson told Deadline he had just watched Alley in an episode of the show while on a plane before learning of her death.
“I was on a plane today and did something I rarely do. I watched an old episode of ‘Cheers,’” Danson told the outlet. “It was the episode where Tom Berenger proposes to Kirstie, who keeps saying no, even though she desperately wants to say yes. Kirstie was truly brilliant in it. Her ability to play a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown was both moving and hysterically funny.”
“She made me laugh 30 years ago when she shot that scene, and she made me laugh today just as hard. As I got off the plane, I heard that Kirstie had died. I am so sad and so grateful for all the times she made me laugh,” Danson added. “I send my love to her children. As they well know, their mother had a heart of gold. I will miss her.”
Another “Cheers” star, Rhea Perlman, told CNN in a statement that she and Alley became friends instantly on the set of “Cheers.”
“Kirstie was a unique and wonderful person and friend. Her joy of being was boundless,” Perlman said. “We became friends almost instantly when she joined the cast of Cheers. She loved kids and my kids loved her too. We had sleepovers at her house, with treasure hunts that she created. She had massive Halloween and Easter parties and invited the entire crew of the show and their families. She wanted everyone to feel included. She loved her children deeply. I’ve never met anyone remotely like her.  I feel so thankful to have known her.  I’m going to miss her very, very much.”
“Baywatch” actor Parker Stevenson, who was married to Alley from 1983 to 1997 and is the father of her two children, also paid tribute to her on social media. In an Instagram post, confirmed to be Stevenson’s by a representative for the actor, he wrote : “Kirstie, I am so grateful for our years together, and for the two incredibly beautiful children and now grandchildren that we have. You will be missed.”"

Alley, who died Monday at the age of 71 after a brief illness, often talked of her feelings for Travolta, whom she called the “greatest love” of her life.
The pair starred together “Look Who’s Talking” film franchise (the first movie hit theaters in 1989). During an appearance in 2018 on “Celebrity Big Brother U.K.” , Alley talked about how easy it is to fall in love with leading men.
She named two co-stars she said she developed feelings for, but never fully consummated the attraction: Patrick Swayze and Travolta.
“I almost ran off and married John. I did love him, I still love him,” Alley said. “If I hadn’t been married I would’ve gone and married him and I would’ve been in an airplane because he has his [own plane.]”
The same year she appeared on the reality show, the “Cheers” star also talked about Travolta during a conversation on “The Dan Wootton Interview” podcast . She said not sleeping with the movie star was “the hardest decision I’ve ever made because I was madly in love with him.”
“We were fun and funny together,” she said. “It wasn’t a sexual relationship because I’m not going to cheat on my husband.”
Alley was married to actor Parker Stevenson at the time. The couple divorced in 1997.
In 2013, Alley told Howard Stern Travolta also had feelings for her, but didn’t act on them because of her marriage.
“It took me years to not look at John as a romantic interest,” she said.
Travolta married actress Kelly Preston in 1991. Alley told Wooten that Preston put her foot down about her flirting with her husband.
“Kelly came up to me and they were married then, and she said, ‘Why are you flirting with my husband?’” Alley said. “And that was sort of when I had to make a decision and that was pretty much the end of that.”
Travolta paid tribute to Alley on social media Monday.
“Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I’ve ever had,” he wrote in the caption on a post on his verified Instagram account. “I love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.”"

The pair appeared on the new Paramount+ series “The Checkup with Dr. David Agus.”
Agus, who is Ashton Kutcher’s doctor, first spoke with the actor about his battle with the autoimmune condition vasculitis .
Later he sat down with the brothers to talk about Michael Kutcher having cerebral palsy and also the moment he almost died as a youngster after contracting viral myocarditis that caused his heart to become enlarged and fail.
The brothers both got emotional about Michael’s heart stopping while Ashton was visiting him in the intensive care unit.
“I go in the room and I’m like ‘Whoa,’” Ashton Kutcher said, fighting back tears. “I’m like…’Everything is not ok.’ And he flatlines in the room and I know that noise cause now I’ve been visiting occasionally.”
He said he considered jumping off a balcony to help his brother since his heart would be a match. Michael Kutcher did receive a donor heart in 24 hours.
He later had to have open heart surgery after a blood clot was discovered. Meanwhile, Ashton Kutcher’s career as a model and actor started taking off and he said he felt guilt.
The “That 70s Show” star said he wondered, “How do I get to be this lucky?”
“For my brother…to be born with cerebral palsy, then have a heart transplant, then have this random blood clot, these things that you’re just like, ‘Who has to go through that?,’” he said.
Michael Kutcher eventually called him out, he said.
“He looked at me and he said, ‘Every time you feel sorry for me, you make me less,’” Ashton Kutcher said. “He said ‘This is the only life I’ve ever known, so stop feeling sorry for the only thing I have.’ And that then created an entire shift back to where I think we are today, which is straight up equals again.”
Michael Kutcher told Agus the brothers drifted apart because of jealousy on his part after his brother became “a household name.”
“There was a moment when I viewed him as receiving more attention than I was,” Michael Kutcher said. “That kind of drove me down to a place where I was jealous.”
The brothers talked it through, Michael Kutcher said, adding, “And once I took all of the fame and everything out of it, I was able to just, you know, come back to him.”
They also had an issue after the actor shared publicly that his brother had cerebral palsy, something Michael Kutcher had not shared. Ashton Kutcher said during the interview that he was not aware that his brother had been keeping it a secret.
Michael Kutcher is now an advocate for the disabled."

Not only did the Oscar-nominated actress get engaged, she also secretly got married well over a year ago.
The “breaking news” was revealed during a lively interview on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” on Monday, in which Sidibe revealed further details on her now husband Brandon Frankel’s engagement proposal in late 2020, as well as their secret wedding in March 2021.
“The thing about weddings is I don’t like them. I don’t like them,” the “Precious” star explained to the hosts. “Here’s an example of how much I don’t like them: I’m actually married. We got married over a year ago.”
The revelation left Ryan Seacrest “confused,” while Kelly Rippa asked if this was indeed “breaking news.”
Frankel, an entertainment business executive , was seen in the audience, confirming the news by raising his hand to show a bejeweled ring finger.
Sidibe went on to share that they were married “at the kitchen table,” and the ceremony was so small, it was “just us.”
She did allow that they will eventually have a wedding to placate her mother-in-law, but that her distaste for the affairs stems from the fact that the actress’s own mother was a wedding singer, meaning she’s “been at a lot of weddings, uninvited” herself.
Frankel posted a series of pictures of the couple showing off their rings to his Instagram also on Monday, writing, “SURPRISE! I can finally call her my WIFE publicly!”
He went on to say that after Sidibe “spilled the beans” on “Live,” he feels “relieved we can finally tell the world.”
“So thankful to have found my forever person, my partner-in-crime, and the love of my life. Every day is the best day with you,” Frankel added. “Nobody I would rather raise cats with and be in bed by a smooth 8pm with. Love you forever”"

Sandler told the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that his musical tribute still makes him emotional. He performed the song as part of his Netflix special “Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh” and sang it on “SNL” when he hosted in May 2019.
“The first few times, we played that song, I would tear up and I couldn’t really sing it well because I’d get so emotional, and then I felt it and was able to get it out there,” Sandler said on the podcast. “It’s weird, but when that song starts, I go, ‘Oh f–k, alright, don’t cry and don’t do that’ still.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/entertainment/george-clooney-star-social-media/index.html,George Clooney has a simple strategy for staying out of trouble as a public figure,,,,CNN,"George Clooney has a surefire way for staying out of trouble as a public figure in the age of social media: stay off of it.
In a profile for the Washington Post published on Friday, the Oscar-winning actor said he manages to avoid too much exposure to today’s 24/7 media cycle by not engaging on those platforms, which he acknowledges would be problematic “if I have three drinks at night.”
He also shared, “I don’t think you can be a star and be that available.”
It was part of a larger conversation in which Clooney identified how certain movie stars that came before him like Gregory Peck and Paul Newman – both of whom were friends of his before they died – exemplified how to carry oneself in the spotlight.
“It doesn’t mean you can’t be goofy and do stupid things, but it means stand up for the things you believe in, carry yourself with a little bit of dignity,” the “Ticket to Paradise” star said. “And both of them had great humor about themselves.”
Clooney, who is being honored at the Kennedy Center this month alongside Gladys Knight and U2, among others, is active in humanitarian efforts in addition to his pursuits as an actor, producer and director.
Ethan Hawke, who directed Clooney in a voice role as Newman in this year’s HBO documentary “The Last Movie Stars,” observed that it’s no surprise he’s getting such a prestigious honor. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
“It’s interesting that he’s getting the Kennedy Center Honors this year because Newman got it too. They fit in a long line of really responsible artists, people who make a contribution to American culture and are civic leaders,” Hawke told the Post. “Whether you like George’s politics, or admire where he gives his money and time, you have to admire his willingness to lead, and his willingness to care.”
Steven Soderbergh, whose 1998 masterpiece “Out of Sight” starred Clooney opposite Jennifer Lopez , said the actor is unique for not caring that his politics might compromise the reach of his stardom.
“The default mode really doesn’t lead you to a place of thinking about fairness, or defending people who can’t defend themselves. It’s great when people use that juice for those purposes, but that’s not the way the stream flows,” Soderbergh said of Clooney’s efforts through his Clooney Foundation for Justice alongside wife Amal, a human rights attorney.
“The stream flows in the direction of self-orientation and being in a mode of extracting whatever you can from this business, and whatever you can from the world at large. … He’s one of the few people who punches upward. That’s rare.”
Clooney will be featured as part of the Kennedy Center Honors on December 28 at 8 p.m. on CBS."

The actor, producer and director, who is starting a new film studio of his own with friend and colleague Matt Damon alongside RedBird Capital Partners, shared his take on Netflix’s approach to moviemaking, which he likened to an “assembly line.”
Making films “is a thing that requires attention and dedication and work and it resists the sort of assembly line process,” Affleck shared in reference to Netflix, while attending the New York Times 2022 DealBook Conference last week.
“[Netflix’s head of original films] Scott Stuber is a really talented, smart guy who I really like…but it’s an impossible job,” he added.
The “Argo” star also said that if you ask Netflix co-CEO and chairman Reed Hastings about their ambitious approach of making 50 great movies, “he’d say, ‘Hey, we went for quantity to establish a footprint.’ I’m sure there’s wisdom in that and I’m sure they had a great strategy, but I would have said, ‘How are we going to make 50 great movies a year? How is that possible?’ There’s no committee big enough. There aren’t enough – you just can’t do it.”
Affleck acknowledged that “there’s (a) bigger audience for action movies than there is for small dramas. I get that. Certain genres play more broadly and you can’t not be mindful of that. But let’s do a good one, let’s surprise the audience, let’s make them care about it.”
At Artists Equity, which is being branded as a creator-led studio, Affleck and company hope to reimagine the relationships between studios, artists and crews working in the industry.
As seen in Variety , Artists Equity already has a first project in production – a yet-to-be-titled drama about the beginnings of Nike’s incredibly popular Air Jordan sneaker brand. Written and directed by Affleck, the film stars Damon as the executive who landed the endorsement deal for the shoe with Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan."

The actress and comedian hosted “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, and during her opening monologue, revealed she is pregnant with her first child.
The “Hustlers” star wore a trench coat with snap buttons and said she wanted “to set the record straight” about some “rumors going around” that she’s having a baby.
“I am!” she continued, whipping open her coat to reveal her bare baby bump underneath.
While closing the clasps on her coat, Palmer then added, “I gotta say, it is bad when people on the Internet spread rumors about you, but it’s even worse when they’re correct!”
She then joked how she had been trying to keep her pregnancy on the “down low” for fear of losing some sponsorship deals, including one with a liquor label.
“Let the check clear, and then we can get to the damn baby shower,” she joked.
Palmer hosted the long-running NBC comedy sketch show alongside musical guest Sza.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/entertainment/christine-mcvie-music/index.html,Christine McVie’s music: 5 songs to listen to in her honor,,,,CNN,"There’s a reason why Christine McVie was considered the heart of Fleetwood Mac.
The band’s keyboardist, who died Wednesday after a brief illness at the age of 79, was also the writer of some of the group’s most beloved songs.
Here are just five of those tunes:
This one is tied to some drama.
Fleetwood Mac is known for, in part, their tumultuous relationships, especially when it came to romantic ones.
Band members Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had a thing that ended badly and McVie was famously married to, and then divorced from, their other bandmate, John McVie.
He reportedly thought the song, with its lyrics “Sweet wonderful you/You make me happy with the things you do/Oh, can it be so/This feeling follows me wherever I go,” was about their dog as the McVies were married at the time.
But it turns out Christine McVie had penned the love song in honor of the band’s lighting director with whom she had an affair.
Another tune from their famed “Rumours” album.
“Don’t Stop” proved to be a hopeful anthem for the future, which was so meaningful to former President Bill Clinton that he used it as his 1992 campaign anthem.
On Wednesday he tweeted a tribute to McVie.
“I’m saddened by the passing of Christine McVie. “Don’t Stop” was my ’92 campaign theme song - it perfectly captured the mood of a nation eager for better days,” he tweeted. “I’m grateful to Christine & Fleetwood Mac for entrusting us with such a meaningful song. I will miss her.”
This one was actually a solo song for McVie.
The first single off of her self-titled solo album, it sounds like it could be a Fleetwood Mac song with it’s buoyant rhythm and the infectious chorus, “Ooh, I got a love/I got somebody/This love got a hold on me.”
Plus Buckingham plays guitar on this one, giving it even more of a Fleetwood Mac vibe.
“Say You Love Me” is a jaunty tune that has become a mainstay on rock and easy listening radio stations.
She reflected on the sweet harmonies, she, Nicks and Buckingham achieve on the tune in a 1990 interview.
“The first time I started playing ‘Say You Love Me’ and I reached the chorus, they started singing with me and fell right into it,” Performing Songwriter magazine reported her saying. “I heard this incredible sound, our three voices … and my skin turned to gooseflesh.”
It feels right that so many on social media used this song to pay tribute to McVie after her passing.
The ballad she wrote has been pointed to as the perfect remembrance of someone lost.
Playing it now after her death seems haunting as she pours her heart into the opening lyrics, “For you, there’ll be no more crying/For you, the sun will be shining/And I feel that when I’m with you/It’s alright, I know it’s right.”"

In the new teaser trailer for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Harrison Ford returns as the titular hero archaeologist, this time alongside “Fleabag” star Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
In this fifth installment, directed by James Mangold, Jones jumps back into action – albeit seemingly reluctantly – to once again go on a grand adventure, despite thinking that his risk-taking days have “come and gone.”
Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Shaunette Renee Wilson and Mads Mikkelsen are part of the cast for the new movie.
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas served as executive producers, with John Williams, who has scored each Indy adventure since the original “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981, once again serving as composer.
Back in September , Ford appeared at Disney’s D23 convention and teased the action to come.
“Indiana Jones movies are about mystery and adventure but they’re also about heart,” he said.
The latest film will likely be Ford’s last as the titular character.
After the audience reacted to the mention of this being his last film in the role, he joked, “This is it. I will not fall down for you again.”
The film hits theaters on June 30, 2023."
https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/entertainment/willow-review/index.html,‘Willow’ review: Warwick Davis returns in Lucasfilm’s series sequel for Disney+,,,,CNN,"Disney’s press materials refer to the original 1988 movie “Willow” as “beloved,” which despite its admirers feels like nostalgic inflation of a pretty generic George Lucas-plotted fantasy that provided an early directing showcase for Ron Howard. Setting that aside, a Disney+ revival series isn’t without its charms, in a more contemporary narrative that brings back Warwick Davis while focusing on the next generation.
The series begins by recounting the events of the movie, which saw Davis’ simple farmer Willow turn sorcerer and join in a fierce battle to protect a baby who carried the kingdom’s destiny on her tiny shoulders, overcoming ancient evil with the help of the swordsman Madmartigan and (eventually) princess Sorsha. The latter were played by Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley, respectively, who as an off-screen bonus got married after the film.
Kilmer, amid his struggle with cancer , remains out of the picture, but Whalley returns as the now-queen and mother of two headstrong grown children, who play roles in a mythical quest that requires journeying across treacherous lands to thwart the evil crone.
As for the aforementioned baby, Elora Danan, she has grown up in anonymity, “Sleeping Beauty”-like, to protect her, although her identity (a not-to-be-revealed spoiler) soon becomes known. The quest includes a colorful band with plenty of youthful relationship issues, including Princess Kit (Ruby Cruz), who is secretly in love with the knight charged with training her (Erin Kellyman, whose credits include Lucasfilm’s “Solo: A Star Wars Story” ); and Boorman (Amar Chadha-Patel), an irreverent brawler in the Madmartigan mode.
Jonathan Kasdan (who also worked on “Solo”) serves as showrunner, collaborating with four directors who each oversaw back-to-back episodes. As constructed, “Willow” draws upon the original while weaving in flourishes that recall the “Lord of the Rings” movies, including lots of sweeping green countryside and abundant, occasionally quite-violent action.
As is so often the case with the growing subgenre of expanded-to-series sequels, this “Willow” at times feels as if it’s spinning its wheels, devoting lengthy stretches to Willow guiding the now-older Elora to master her powers, which he presents as the only hope of saving the kingdom. And while Kilmer’s absence leaves a sizable hole Kasdan and company do a reasonably good job of filling it, including the late arrival of another knight (Christian Slater) with whom Madmartigan shared some history.
Beyond modern-sounding dialogue and situations, the story does exhibit plenty of playful irreverence and humor mixed in among the action sequences and elaborate fantasy production design. The latter in particular suggest that this revival was no small undertaking, and to its credit, it looks like that money ended up on the screen.
While that combination doesn’t add up into making “Willow” significantly worthier of the “beloved” label than its late-’80s predecessor, consumed on its own unpretentious terms, it’s easy enough to like.
“Willow” premieres November 30 on Disney+."

But nearly 20 years on from the release of the 2003 romantic comedy , the movie has faced scrutiny over its story lines and lack of diversity.
“There were things you’d change but thank god society is changing. So my film is bound, in some moments, to feel, you know, out of date,” the movie’s writer and director Richard Curtis said earlier this week.
He was speaking to Diane Sawyer as part of a documentary on ABC News titled: “The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later.”

“Love Actually” features interweaving story lines, following several romantic relationships. However, most of the leading cast is White and all the relationships depicted are heterosexual.
Asked about any moments that might make him “wince,” Curtis said: “The lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid.” He added: “I think there are three plots that have bosses and people who work for them.”
The movie features an impressive number of big names from the entertainment industry, with Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman, Laura Linney, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson and Thomas Brodie-Sangster all appearing at some point.
Nearly 20 years on, “Love Actually” remains popular, becoming a staple of the holiday season.
“It’s amazing the way it’s entered the language,” Nighy said in the ABC News documentary.
“I’ve had people coming up to me saying ‘it got me through my chemotherapy,’ or ‘it got me through my divorce,’ or ‘I watch it whenever I’m alone.’ And people do, and people have ‘Love Actually’ parties.”
When asked if she understood why “Love Actually” had remained popular, Thompson replied: “I so do.”
“Because I think that we forget, time and time again we forget, that love is all that matters.”
Curtis has written several other popular romantic comedies, including “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” “Notting Hill” and “Bridget Jones’s Diary.”
“Four Weddings and a Funeral” was released in 1994 and notably portrayed a same-sex relationship between Matthew, played by John Hannah, and Gareth, played by Simon Callow.
Writing in the Guardian 14 years later, Callow said: “It almost defies belief, but in the months after the release of the film, I received a number of letters from apparently intelligent, articulate members of the public saying that they had never realised, until seeing the film, that gay people had emotions like normal people.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/entertainment/joe-pesci-burns-home-alone-2/index.html,Joe Pesci says playing Harry in the ‘Home Alone’ films came with some ‘serious’ pain,,,,CNN,"They say artists have to be willing to do anything for their art, and for Joe Pesci, that includes setting his head on fire.
In a new interview with People , the Oscar winner reflected on the making “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” on the occasion of the sequel’s 30th anniversary and remembered how the comedy required some physically “demanding” stunts on his part.
“It was a nice change of pace to do that particular type of slapstick comedy,” Pesci said of making the first two “Home Alone” films in the email interview, published on Tuesday.
In the uber-successful franchise, Pesci played one half a bungling thief duo (alongside Daniel Stern) who is continually one-upped by a clever kid played by Macaulay Culkin. He acknowledged that the movies “were a more physical type of comedy, therefore, a little more demanding.”
One example – when Pesci’s character Harry walks unsuspectingly into a booby trap laid by Culkin’s Kevin, leading to a fiery finish.
“In addition to the expected bumps, bruises, and general pains that you would associate with that particular type of physical humor, I did sustain serious burns to the top of my head during the scene where Harry’s hat is set on fire,” the “Goodfellas” star recalled.
In fact, Harry’s head is set ablaze not once but twice in the movies, once in 1990’s “Home Alone” and again in the 1992 film, when Harry and Marv (Stern) chase Kevin through a house amid renovations. (Pesci did not clarify during which film he sustained his injury.)
Pesci added that he “was fortunate enough to have professional stuntmen do the real heavy stunts.”
“Home Alone 2,” which hit theaters on November 20, 1992 , welcomed back Pesci, Culkin and Stern along with Catherine O’Hara and John Heard as Kevin’s parents. The movie also starred Oscar-winning actress Brenda Fricker as the Pigeon Lady."
https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/entertainment/stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-friendship-cec/index.html,Inside Stevie Nicks’ and Christine McVie’s decades-long friendship,,,,CNN,"Throughout the various personal turmoils for which the members of Fleetwood Mac are known, one relationship buoyed the band for decades: the friendship between its two frontwomen, Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks .
McVie joined the band in 1970 during one of its early lineup changes and for years was its only woman. When Nicks was added to the lineup in 1975, the two became fast friends.
Theirs was not a competitive relationship, but a sisterly one – both women were gifted songwriters responsible for crafting many of the band’s best-known tunes. Though the two grew apart in the 1980s amid Nicks’ worsening drug addiction and the band’s growing internal tension, they came back together when McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac in 2014.
At a concert in London, shortly before McVie officially rejoined the band, Nicks dedicated the song “Landslide” to her “mentor. Big sister. Best friend.” And at the show’s end, McVie was there, accompanying her bandmates for “Don’t Stop.”
“I never want her to ever go out of my life again, and that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with her and I as friends,” Nicks told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.
On Wednesday, McVie, the band’s “ songbird ,” died after a brief illness at age 79.  Below, revisit McVie’s and Nicks’ years-long relationship as bandmates, best friends and “sisters.”
The story of Nicks joining Fleetwood Mac is legend now: Band founder and drummer Mick Fleetwood wanted to recruit guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, who stipulated that he would only join if his girlfriend and musician Nicks could join, too. McVie cast the deciding vote, and the rest is history.
“It was critical that I got on with her because I’d never played with another girl,” McVie told the Guardian in 2013. “But I liked her instantly. She was funny and nice but also there was no competition. We were completely different on the stage to each other and we wrote differently too.”
Throughout the band’s many personal complications – McVie married and divorced Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie and had an affair with the band’s lighting director, while Nicks had rollercoaster romances with Buckingham and Fleetwood – they were each other’s center.
“To be in a band with another girl who was this amazing musician – (McVie) kind of instantly became my best friend,” Nicks told the New Yorker earlier this year. “Christine was a whole other ballgame. She liked hanging out with the guys. She was just more comfortable with men than I had ever been.”
The two protected each other, Nicks said, in a male-dominated industry: “We made a pact, in the very beginning, that we would never be treated with disrespect by all the male musicians in the community.
“I would say to her, ‘Together, we are a serious force of nature, and it will give us the strength to maneuver the waters that are ahead of us,’” Nicks told the New Yorker.
“Rumours” was the band’s greatest success to date when it was released in 1977. But the band’s relationships with each other were deteriorating, save for the one between McVie and Nicks. While the pair were enduring breakups with their significant others, Nicks and McVie spent their time offstage together.
The Guardian asked McVie if she was trying to offset the band’s tumult with her songs on “Rumours,” including the lighthearted “You Make Lovin’ Fun” and optimistic “Don’t Stop.” She said she likely had been.
As multiple members’ drug use intensified, the band’s dynamic grew tense. McVie distanced herself from the group in 1984 amid her bandmates’ addictions, telling the Guardian she was “just sick of it.” Nicks, meanwhile, was becoming dependent on cocaine.
McVie told Rolling Stone that year that she’d grown apart from Nicks: “She seems to have developed her own fantasy world, somehow, which I’m not part of. We don’t socialize much.”
In 1986, Nicks checked into the Betty Ford Center to treat her addiction, though she later became addicted to Klonopin, which she said claimed years of her life. She quit the prescription drug in the 1990s.
After recording some solo works, McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac for their 1987 album “Tango in the Night,” and two of her songs on that record – “Little Lies” and “Everywhere” – became major hits. But Nicks departed the band soon after, and the band’s best-known lineup wouldn’t officially reunite until 1997 for “The Dance” tour and subsequent live album.
The reunion was short-lived: After the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, McVie officially quit Fleetwood Mac, citing a fear of flying and exhaustion of life on the road.
In the 2010s, after more than a decade of retirement, McVie toyed with returning to performing. She officially rejoined Fleetwood Mac after calling Fleetwood himself and gauging what her return would mean for the group.
“Fortunately Stevie was dying for me to come back, as were the rest of the band,” she told the Arts Desk.
In 2015, a year after she’d rejoined Fleetwood Mac, McVie hit the road with her bandmates. Touring with the group was tiring but fun, the first time they’d performed together in years.
“I’m only here for Stevie,” she told the New Yorker that year.
Nicks concurred: “When we went on the road, I realized what an amazing friend she’d been of mine that I had lost and didn’t realize the whole consequences of it till now,” she told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.
During that tour, McVie wore a silver chain that Nicks had given her – a “metaphor,” McVie told the New Yorker, “that the chain of the band will never be broken. Not by me, anyways. Not again by me.”
McVie told the Arts Desk in 2016 that she and Nicks were “better friends now than (they) were 16 years ago.”
Touring with Buckingham and Fleetwood could quickly get tumultuous for Nicks, McVie said, due to their shared history. “But with me in there, it gave Stevie the chance to get her breath back and not have this constant thing going on with Lindsey: her sister was back,” she said.
Their mutual praise continued: In 2019, McVie said Nicks was “just unbelievable” onstage: “The more I see her perform on stage the better I think she is. She holds the fort.”
When their 2018-2019 tour ended, though – without Buckingham, who was fired – the band “kind of broke up,” McVie told Rolling Stone earlier this year. She added that she didn’t speak with Nicks as often as she did when they toured together.
As for a reunion, McVie told Rolling Stone that while it wasn’t off the table, she wasn’t feeling “physically up for it.”
“I’m getting a bit long in the teeth here,” she said. “I’m quite happy being at home. I don’t know if I ever want to tour again. It’s bloody hard work.”
News of McVie’s death rattled Nicks, who wrote that she had only found out McVie was sick days earlier. She called McVie her “best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975.”
On her social media accounts, Nicks shared a handwritten note containing lyrics from the Haim song “Hallelujah,” some of which discusses grief and the loss of a best friend.
“See you on the other side, my love,” Nicks wrote. “Don’t forget me – Always, Stevie.”"

The Broadway musical “The Phantom of the Opera” announced in September that it would be closing in February because of declining ticket sales, but plans have changed.
On Tuesday, the show’s producer, Cameron Mackintosh, announced the show will now run until April 16.
An unexpected bolster in sales, as well as a busy Thanksgiving week, helped the longest-running show in Broadway history earn $2.2 million in sales last week, according to The New York Times .
“What a phenomenal response there has been to the show ending,” Mackintosh told the Times. “We’ve sold out virtually everything that we have on sale.”
The musical will celebrate its 35th anniversary in January.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/entertainment/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce/index.html,Kim Kardashian and Kanye West reach divorce settlement,,,,CNN,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have come to a divorce agreement, a source with knowledge of the negotiations tells CNN.
Per the agreement, a draft of which was obtained by CNN, Kardashian will receive $200,000 per month in child support from West, who last year legally changed his name to Ye , and share joint custody of their four children.
CNN has reached out to representatives for Kardashian and West for comment.
Kardashian filed for divorce from West in February 2021, citing irreconcilable differences.
The couple was married in a lavish wedding in Italy in 2014.
In March 2022 , Kardashian was declared legally single after being granted a request to change her marital status.
In an interview with Vogue earlier this year, the Skims founder explained what led to her high-profile split, saying, that “for so long, I did what made other people happy” and that she decided “I’m going to make myself happy.”
She went on to say that “even if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think it’s important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy.”
“I’ve chosen myself,” she told the publication. “I think it’s okay to choose you.”
In September, West , who in the latter part of this year has lost multiple business partnerships following a string of antisemitic comments , publicly apologized to Kardashian in an interview with “Good Morning America” for “any stress” he’s caused her.
“This is the mother of my children, and I apologize for any stress that I have caused, even in my frustration because God calls me to be stronger,” West said."
https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/entertainment/marsai-martin-omari-hardwick-fantasy-football/index.html,Marsai Martin and Omari Hardwick play to win in ‘Fantasy Football’,,,,CNN,"The new film “Fantasy Football” capitalizes on some of its stars natural talent.
Marsai Martin channels lots of girl-boss energy playing Callie Coleman, a tech-savvy young woman whose father’s long career in the NFL lands him with the Atlanta Falcons team.
Her production company is behind the family-friendly film. (Martin, 18, set a Guinness World Record in 2020 as the youngest Hollywood executive producer to work on a major production.)
She and costars Omari Hardwick (Bobby Coleman), Rome Flynn (Anderson Fisher), along with the film’s director Anton Cropper, recently spoke with CNN when they appeared at a Falcons game held at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.
It was familiar surroundings as the group shot plenty of scenes for their movie there.
The plot centers around Callie’s father, played by Hardwick, seemingly at the end of his career when his daughter discovers she can control his moves via playing the Madden football video game.
Martin sees the role in which her character also makes friends with the robotics club team members at her new school as more than just fun with its positive message about diversity in technology.
“I’ve met so many girls who are in to technology and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) or are all about Black girls coding,” she said. “It’s important to shine a light on it because it’s a very big deal. It’s all about representation.”
For Hardwick, the project gave him the opportunity to lean into his football roots.
Before he became famous for his work in roles like James “Ghost” St. Patrick on “Power,” the Savannah, Georgia native played as a defensive back at the University of Georgia and later tried out with the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent.
“It feels incredible to be right back here at home,” Hardwick said. “This is obviously my hometown team…but I never got to play for the Falcons. With this film, I got to do my thing.”
Hardwick also pointed out that it was appropriate that they were attending a game in which the Atlanta Falcons were playing the Chicago Bears given that Rome Flynn, who plays Bobby Coleman’s rival, the hotshot young quarterback Anderson Fisher, grew up in Chicago.
Flynn told CNN that unlike their characters, he and Hardwick had no competition between them as leading men.
“It’s all love,” he said smiling. “We respect each other and we brought out the best in each other.”

https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/entertainment/wednesday-review/index.html,‘Wednesday’ review: Jenna Ortega makes Netflix’s Addams Family series look like a snap,,,,CNN,"Although the main character’s name was inspired by the poetic line “Wednesday’s child is full of woe,” “Wednesday” is generally a delight, thanks almost entirely to Jenna Ortega. Having outgrown her Disney Channel days, Ortega makes the Addams Family’s now-high-school-age daughter the coolest humorless goth sociopath you’ll ever meet, in a Netflix series that’s more kooky than spooky or ooky.
Director Tim Burton sets just the right visual tone – a mix of the comedic and macabre that resembles “Edward Scissorhands” – while teaming up with “Smallville” producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who know something about building a TV show around an extraordinary teen. Indeed, when Wednesday gets enrolled in a new private school, Nevermore Academy, she tells the headmistress (“Game of Thrones’” Gwendoline Christie) about her frequent moves from school to school, “They haven’t built one strong enough to hold me.”
That might change at Nevermore, a Poe-etic name for this haven for the weird and witchy, with a supernatural vibe that’s as much Hogwarts (or X-Men) as Charles Addams’ signature comic strip.
Not only does Wednesday have to deal with dawning psychic abilities and the strange visions that go with them, but a mystery emerges that turns the suspicious lass into an ill-tempered, ebon-clad Nancy Drew, trying to ascertain who’s responsible as the clues begin to circle back to her own family tree.
It’s obviously a fairly derivative mashup of genre elements, but the mix works in part because even the smaller ingredients are tasty, from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman as Wednesday’s parents, Morticia and Gomez, to her sidekick Thing, who obtains a dress she wants by employing – what else? – a “five-fingered discount.” The writers extract a great deal of comedic mileage from that extremity, so give them a hand.
What separates “Wednesday” from similar efforts (Netflix’s “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” comes to mind), ultimately, is Ortega, who somehow manages to be relentlessly strange, a portrait in unblinking intensity and oddly endearing all at once. When the character description includes never raising one’s voice or cracking even the hint of a smile, that’s no small feat.
Throw in nifty touches like having Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday in the 1990s movies, as part of the school staff, and the local sheriff (Jamie McShane) dismissing Wednesday and her classmates as “the Scooby gang,” and the series operates on multiple levels.
Perhaps inevitably, “Wednesday” can’t sustain its initial kick as the serialized story unfolds over eight episodes, and the ending becomes too chaotic. Then again, that’s hardly a surprise given the nature of source material designed more for little jokes than a big sweeping story.
Seeking to bring something new a property like the Addams Family, which has been done so many times before, isn’t easy without altering its DNA. To its credit, “Wednesday” rises to the challenge and mostly manages to make it look like a snap.
“Wednesday” premieres November 23 on Netflix."
https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/entertainment/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-review/index.html,‘Glass Onion’ sharpens the ‘Knives Out’ formula in a polished Netflix sequel,,,,CNN,"Rising to the challenge of matching its successful predecessor , “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” maintains the razor-sharp formula, with a setup that feels even more conspicuously like an Agatha Christie homage before an extremely clever series of twists kick in. Writer-director Rian Johnson again assembles a solid cast behind Daniel Craig , but it’s his use of language – where nary a word is wasted – that finally gives the sequel its edge.
Netflix opportunistically stepped up to acquire the “Knives Out” franchise and, departing from its usual “Stroke the filmmakers’ egos” approach to theatrical distribution, will actually give the movie a wide one-week-only release before it hits the streaming service in late December. Most people will probably still wait to consume it in the comfort of their homes, but for those who do take the plunge, it certainly plays well with an appreciative audience.
After the family dynamics in “Knives Out,” which gave everyone a motive to kill off the patriarch, Johnson tries his hand in a different setting, with an eccentric billionaire, Miles Bron (Edward Norton), inviting his old posse of pals to a murder-mystery getaway (during Covid, no less) on his secluded Greek isle, where they’ll be tasked with solving his “murder.”
The game, however, takes an unexpected turn, starting with the invitation to Craig’s master detective Benoit Blanc, who remains brilliant and odd in near-equal measure.
As for the eclectic roster of guests/potential killers (and/or victims), they include a fashion designer/social-media loose cannon (Kate Hudson) and her partner (Jessica Henwick), a fitness influencer (Dave Bautista) and his girlfriend/sidekick (Madelyn Cline), a scientist (Leslie Odom Jr.), a politician (Kathryn Hahn), and most intriguingly, Miles’ estranged former business partner (Janelle Monáe).
Although the latest movie obviously lacks the sense of discovery that greeted the original – and even turned Chris Evans’ sweater into a must-have item (Chris Evans not included), Johnson is smart enough to recognize that while this is about reloading, not reinventing, the change in venues can still refresh the formula.
Craig, moreover, is clearly having a ball with this new signature role, trading in his tuxedos and physicality for a more cerebral form of crimefighting, with a Hercule Poirot-like gift for eavesdropping and a Foghorn Leghorn Southern twang.

In one of those “Kneel before Zod!” flexes, Netflix reportedly paid a fortune to acquire these sequels, which is frankly just the kind of deal that threatens to take a fun little movie and screw it up by creating unreasonable expectations.
Happily, “Glass Onion” finds new layers to explore, in a way that makes the prospect of a new “Knives Out Mystery” every few years sound like a perfectly reasonable idea, wherever and however one chooses to consume it.

The special airs Sunday, November 27 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CNN.
One of the most beloved modern Christmas classics is turning 20 next year, and to mark the occasion, cast members from the landmark 2003 romantic comedy “Love Actually ” are reuniting for a TV special to air on ABC next week, the network announced Tuesday.
Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson , Bill Nighy and Thomas Brodie-Sangster are taking part in the special, along with the film’s writer-director Richard Curtis.
In a promotional clip shared by ABC program “20/20” on Twitter, Diane Sawyer asks the cast to fill in the sentence, “Love actually is…,” to which Grant drolly answers, “Dead!”
According to ABC, the special will look at how the film successfully corralled a diverse ensemble to create a charming and winsome film examining various loving relationships during a frantic month leading up to Christmas in London, England, going on to become a beloved holiday tradition around the world.
The program, which comes a little early, considering the film was released on November 6, 2003, will also look at how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the ways people interact, love and connect, and the all-important need for kindness in families and communities.
The new reunion is not the first time the actors from “Love Actually” – who also include Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson and Colin Firth – have come together again.
In 2017, a short sequel to the film was produced for NBC in honor of Red Nose Day, a charity for children in need created by Curtis.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/entertainment/james-cameron-leonardo-dicaprio-kate-winslet-titanic/index.html,Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet almost didn’t to star in ‘Titanic’,,,,CNN,"James Cameron is sharing some surprising details from the making of his blockbuster hit “Titanic,” which celebrates 25 years of being released next month.
In a new video interview with GQ , the iconic director revealed that he almost didn’t end up casting Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet – his two romantic leads whose careers as major Hollywood movie stars were cemented by the landmark Oscar-winning film.
While considering actors to play the roles of his star-crossed lovers on the doomed ocean liner, Cameron explained that he was initially thinking of someone like Gwyneth Paltrow for Rose, and that while Winslet had been proposed as an option, he was afraid she was too much of a typecast.
“I actually didn’t see Kate at first,” he said in the video. “She had done a couple of other historical dramas as well, and she was getting a reputation as ‘Corset Kate’ doing historical stuff.” (It is true that “The Reader” actress’s three credits prior to “Titanic” were also period costume dramas – “Sense and Sensibility” in 1995, followed by “Jude” and “Hamlet” one year later.)
Cameron went on to say that he was afraid that putting Winslet in the role “was going to look like the laziest casting in the world,” but that he nonetheless agreed to meet her in the end. Of course, he thought she was “fantastic,” and the rest is history.
With DiCaprio, meanwhile, there were some initial hiccups.
After an initial “hysterical” meeting with the heartthrob actor, in which all the women in the production office somehow ended up in the conference room alongside Cameron, DiCaprio was invited back for a screen test with Winslet, who had already been cast at that point.
But when the “Romeo + Juliet” star came in, he was surprised to learn he’d have to read lines and be filmed alongside Winslet to gauge their chemistry on camera.
“He came in, he thought it was another meeting to meet Kate,” Cameron described.
He remembered telling the pair, “We’ll just run some lines, and I’ll video it.”
But then DiCaprio – who by then had led several movies and scored an Oscar nomination for 1993’s “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape” – informed Cameron, “You mean I’m reading?…I don’t read,” meaning that he no longer submitted to having to audition for film roles.
Without missing a beat, Cameron extended his hand to the star and and told him, “Well, thanks for coming by.”
The director then explained to DiCaprio the enormity of the project before them, how the film was going to take two years out of his life, and how he was “not going to f**k it up by making the wrong decision in casting.”
“So you’re going to read or you’re not going to get the part,” Cameron said he told the young actor.
DiCaprio reluctantly submitted, to his credit.
Cameron remembered how the actor “lit up” and “became Jack,” creating electric chemistry with Winslet later seen plainly in the film itself.
“Titanic” sailed into theaters on December 19, 1997 and eventually went on to win 11 Academy Awards, including best director for Cameron."

For over 500 years, Michelangelo’s sculpture of David in Florence has stood unchanged, the marble icon of masculinity, and one of the world’s most famous works of art.
But as Italy emerges from the pandemic, the David has got a whole new look.
A new lighting system has revolutionized how the famous statue looks, with small details visible for the first time in its history.
“A few days ago, I noticed muscles on the body that I’d never seen before,” says Lucia Lazic, a guide who visits the Accademia Gallery most days.
“I said, ‘What on earth? How have I never seen this?’ The lighting is much better on the David.”
Cecilie Hollberg, director of the Accademia, said in a statement that the lighting has “changed the visual perception of the artworks,” telling CNN that the David’s marble looks “whiter” and that the details are “more visible.”
The lighting – completed in September as part of works that were unveiled this week – aimed to bring the “dynamism of sunlight” into the Tribuna room where the statue is kept under a domed skylight.
LED spotlights were installed in a circle above the statue, allowing them to “completely envelop the David and leave the rest of the space in the background.”
The color of the light changes imperceptibly during the day, while the spotlights are of varying warmth, allowing visitors to get a new perspective with every step around the statue.
The new-look David is part of a wider revamp of the museum, which was Italy’s second most visited in 2019.
The Galleria dei Prigioni, or “prisoners corridor” – named after Michelangelo’s four semi-finished sculptures of prisoners of war, which share the space with two of his other works – has also had its lighting switched up, with several spotlights pointed on each sculpture.
“It used to be that the prisoners looked yellow, and David was white. Now they’re the same color,” Hollberg told CNN.
“You can now see every chisel mark on them.”

The new lighting system, which “restores the right balance of chiaroscuro and color to the works,” is also energy-efficient. Hollberg says the gallery should use around 80% less electricity than in previous years.
It’s not just the headline works that are looking different. Several of the other rooms of the gallery have had their previously beige walls painted in colors that maximize those in the paintings.
The Sala del Colosso, the gallery’s first room, is now a bright blue, while the 13th and 14th-century rooms are a pale green, chosen to bring out the gold used in most of the paintings.
And the new lighting everywhere has transformed the paintings from things tourists used to rush past en route to David, to unmissable in their own right.
“One regular visitor said, ‘Where was all this detail? We never saw it,’” Hollberg told CNN. “In one painting by Domenico Ghirlandaio you can now see all the gold dots in the [saints’] halos. Before, the beige walls flattened the gold. In another, it feels like you could pluck the pearls from the painting – before you couldn’t see them at all.
“My job is to give value and visibility to all the works. Every single work here is a masterpiece, but works die on a beige background – they need to be lifted and supported by color. I want to give them what they deserve.”
In the past, the lighting was so bad that some paintings were barely visible – like those beside the David. “Before it was all dark, you couldn’t see them – no one stopped,” said Hollberg. One time she saw a guide shining their phone torch on another painting in a bid to show it to visitors.
Tourists have already changed their behavior, she said.
“Now they stop and look. They’re not all in front of the David like before. I’ve followed groups, and they used to cut through the Sala del Colosso and never stop. Now I see that room full of visitors – it’s redistributing the crowds.”
Lazic, a guide with Elite Italian Experience, agrees: “There are more people stopping in the Sala del Colosso.”

The renovations, which started just before the pandemic and which have been rolled out this year, have finished with the revamp of the Gipsoteca. The plaster cast gallery was another rush-through place. That’s if it was open – with no open windows or air conditioning, it used to close at midday during the summer.
But now with air conditioning, powder blue walls and a new layout for the 414 plaster casts – mostly done by sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini, whose works are found in the Louvre, Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art – it’s a place to linger.
Hollberg says that locals are starting to appreciate the museum, too. “Before it was a space for tourists, but Florentines are rediscovering it. We got the last resisters in with a concert series.”
Dario Franceschini, Italy’s minister of culture, called the reopening of the Gipsoteca “an important step… in bringing [the Accademia] into the 21st century.”
He added: “The works across the entire building have allowed significant innovations in the systems, transforming a museum conceived in the late 19th century into a modern venue without distorting it.”"

Digital currencies bitcoin, ether and solana were among the most affected cryptocurrencies, bringing total liquidations to $18.28 billion as of 3:47 p.m. ET, according to data analysis platform CoinGlass . The losses for cryptocurrencies come amid a broad sell-off, as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on Friday saw their steepest declines in six months.
In the past 24 hours, roughly $5 billion of bitcoin has been liquidated, along with about $4 billion of ether and about $2 billion of solana, according to CoinGlass.
It’s the “largest liquidation event in crypto history,” CoinGlass said in a post on X .
Bitcoin is down almost 10% in the last five days and was trading at $111.616.20 as of 3:45 p.m. ET, a jump from when it dropped to $103,000 at 5:15 p.m. ET on Friday.
On Friday, ether was priced at $4,365.63 and then sunk to $3,742.88 — a 14.2% decline.
Solana was priced at $223.10 on Friday and has fallen to $178.72, as of 3:45 p.m. ET — a nearly 20% plunge.
Crypto has made major gains since Trump took office this year, in large part because of the president’s turnaround from dismissing bitcoin as “based on thin air” to addressing crypto fans at conventions , launching his own meme coin and promising a strategic crypto reserve.
And Trump recently issued an executive order allowing digital assets like crypto to be included in 401(k) plans, causing bitcoin to soar to a record high of $124,000 last week.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/politics/republicans-military-paychecks-shutdown,GOP leaders steadfast in shutdown stance despite rising pressure inside party,,,,CNN,"Top Republicans in Congress will take a massive gamble on shutdown politics in the coming days: GOP leaders will not step in to prevent missed paychecks to the military.
It’s the most dramatic step yet by Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson to attempt to force Democrats to end the government shutdown, even as they realize their party will, too, face political pain for the move. And it comes at a high-stakes moment for both parties: This would be the first time in recent history that active-duty military service members will miss a paycheck on a large scale during a shutdown.
President Donald Trump, however, said Saturday that he’s “identified funds” to get troops paid next week. The funds for military pay will come from the Pentagon’s research and development money that’s available for two years, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget.
Behind the scenes, Thune and Johnson have agreed that Republicans can make no attempts to lessen the pain they argue Democrats are causing millions of Americans by rejecting the GOP’s plan to simply extend current funding — concerned that if Congress took that step, Democrats would face less pressure to reopen the government, according to multiple GOP leadership sources.
As the shutdown drags into its third week, tensions are rising in the GOP with no clear way out. Lawmakers are angry at one another for getting into now-viral hallway confrontations with Democrats or doing high-profile interviews where they blame their own party for the lapse. Some are angry at GOP leadership for failing to address the military pay issue from the start, or for the optics of keeping the House out of session for weeks on end. But those CNN spoke with expressed an acute anger at Senate Democrats.
“I’m going back to DC. I’ve had enough,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, who has raised his concerns with House GOP leadership. “I just can’t fathom why we would not be there.”
But Thune and Johnson are publicly resolute in their position, and the party remains in lockstep on big-picture strategy: Republicans will make no guarantee on Affordable Care Act subsidies , and the only way out of a shutdown is for Senate Democrats to retreat, despite any political pain that the GOP will feel over the missed paychecks , according to interviews with two dozen lawmakers and senior aides. It underscores the depth of Congress’ ugly stalemate, with Democrats equally dug in.
“We’re in a bind as Republicans, but they’re in a huge bind as Democrats,” Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said, summing up the party’s mood. Even Van Drew, who believes the party needs to take action on the expiring subsidies, was clear that Democrats must be the ones to yield.
Both Thune and Johnson have stressed that Democrats are blocking the military pay. “Well, there’s a military pay bill right here,” Thune said on Friday, holding up a paper copy of the GOP stopgap spending bill. “All they have to do is pick it up at the desk, give us five votes and the military gets paid.”
Inside the upper rungs of leadership, Republicans have been astounded by Democrats’ continued rejection of a bill to extend Biden-era funding levels and their hardline position on the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. But publicly and privately, GOP lawmakers in both chambers have expressed they believe the public will ultimately support their argument — despite some early polling favoring Democrats — and are prepared to let the shutdown drag on until Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backs down.
“We think we’re winning this argument,” one GOP campaign operative said, summing up the party’s overarching position.
Still, it’s not an easy stance for the GOP, a party that sees itself as champions of the military. For many members of leadership, it’s personal, too: Thune hails from a military family, while Johnson’s son attends the Naval Academy. Others in leadership, like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, also have children serving in the military.
As that anxiety builds, Johnson and his team have fielded a number of calls from House Republicans this week urging him to bring the chamber back into session so troops do not have to miss their October 15 paycheck, multiple GOP sources told CNN.
GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, a former Navy helicopter pilot whose district is home to more than 88,000 active-duty military members, introduced legislation to pay troops in September and the bill has nearly 150 co-sponsors, with the majority of them being Republicans. Kiggans is also one of the GOP’s most politically endangered members in next year’s midterms.
In a statement, Kiggans called on Schumer to vote to open the government, and said she has also encouraged GOP leadership to hold a vote on her bill to ensure service members get paid. “I have spoken to Speaker Johnson and our House leadership about this bill since before the shutdown. I have encouraged them to bring this bipartisan bill to the House floor for a vote,” the congresswoman said. “I would support returning to Washington to pass this bill if needed.”
Another supporter of that bill, GOP Rep. Ken Calvert, who oversees defense funding in the House, said in a statement to CNN that troops’ pay should not be held up by the government funding fight. (Calvert faces a potential GOP primary next year because of his state’s Democratic redistricting push.)
“I will always make the pay and welfare of our troops a top priority as Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee. We can have policy and political fights in Congress, but we simply can’t ask service members to put themselves in harm’s way without paying them” Calvert said. “It should be a red line for anyone who cares about our national security and our troops.”
In a preview of this week’s pain, Johnson was recently confronted by a C-SPAN live caller who is a military wife and mother, urging him to pass legislation to allow active-duty military service members to get paid during the government shutdown. And some House Republicans are frustrated in the GOP’s message.
“I don’t think it matters to her if you say, ‘Oh well, you know the Senate’s to blame, or Chuck Schumer is to blame. It doesn’t really matter to her or to her children who is to blame, what matters is they’re not going to get paychecks,” Kiley told CNN. “And if we have a way to make sure that they do get their paycheck, then we should absolutely do that even if we don’t solve the larger problem.”
“I’d vote for that in a minute,” GOP Rep. Mark Amodei, a former Army lawyer who served in the Judge Advocate General Corps, said on the prospect of voting on military pay.
But Johnson and his leadership team have held firm that the House has done its job by passing a clean extension of government funding — which included pay for the military and federal workforce through late November. And notably, members haven’t taken any drastic steps to buck leadership and force votes on a bill.
A senior House Republican argued that Democrats merely want a “show vote” in support of troops.
There have been some glimpses of daylight between the two GOP leaders on the issue, however. Earlier this week, Johnson and Thune initially offered different answers on the military pay issue. The GOP speaker did not rule out the idea of a standalone bill, while Thune was clear he would not bring it up. That mix-up prompted a brief check-in between the Senate Republican leader and his House counterpart to make sure the two were on the same page, according to three people familiar with the exchange. Johnson has privately said it was just a verbal misstep and that he did indeed support the strategy, one of those sources said.
GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a retired Navy SEAL who was serving in the military when the government shut down in 2013, told CNN that Democrats are “playing politics with our service members’ pay” by wanting a separate vote to fund the military.
“They’re trying to get out of this. But they are responsible,” he said.
In lieu of congressional action, there was some discussion of whether the White House can step in to pay troops without congressional approval. One idea being floated was for the White House to use revenue generated from tariffs, but one senior House GOP aide cautioned that is “a big question mark.”
Republicans also insist Democrats are making a major miscalculation in their shutdown demands.
Democrats have said they will not agree to reopen the government until they have a concrete deal to prevent billions of dollars in those subsidies from lapsing at year’s end.
But Republicans are privately not sure whether there will be a deal at all. Senior members of GOP leadership in both chambers are unsure whether any version of a subsidies measure can pass with enough Republican votes. Any deal would would likely require extended negotiations, with clear buy-in from Trump — and Congress is running out of time.
Some center-right Republicans have been vocal about the need to do something about the deadline: They acknowledge that many of those receiving subsidies are their own voters and that the party can’t afford politically to simply let that lapse.
“To get rid of the credits, it’s morally bankrupt and politically stupid,” Van Drew said, adding that he’s spoken to both Johnson and Trump about the issue. “We do need to do something.”
But he acknowledged the fight will be “messy” — and that the longer Democrats refuse to back the spending bill, the less time they have to find a resolution.
Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York is another center-right Republican who is in favor of extending the subsidies in some fashion. But the Staten Island Republican said she — and the rest of the party — won’t support a simple extension as the Democrats are demanding.
“This is really their mess. I think Republicans need to work with them to clean up their mess. But it needs to be something that’s comprehensive and reins in the insurance companies,” Malliotakis said. “It fell in our lap. There’s bipartisan support to do something here. If we open the government, we’ll be able to come to that resolution.”

Mayor John Lee told CNN that 16 people were shot and four were killed near downtown Leland around midnight. Lee did not clarify whether he counted the four dead among the 16.
No one was in custody in connection with the shooting, he said. An investigation is underway, the Leland Police Department told CNN when asked about reports of a shooting. It did not release further information.
The shooting happened during a gathering after Leland High School’s homecoming football game, CNN affiliate WAPT reported , citing state Sen. Derrick Simmons. CNN was not immediately able to reach Simmons.
“People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,” Simmons told The Associated Press.
“It’s just senseless gun violence,” he said, according to the AP. “What we are experiencing now is just a proliferation of guns just being in circulation.”
The shooting did not happen near the high school, said Lee, who did not offer further details about the shooting to CNN. Leland, a city of about 4,000 residents , is about a 115-mile drive northwest of the state’s capital, Jackson.
The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said it is assisting in the investigation, but deferred to Leland police for release of details about the incident.
FBI Director Kash Patel said in a post on X the agency “is aware and engaged,” regarding the Leland shooting, and is “mobilizing assets to assist local authorities in the case.”
“Please pray for the victims and their families. We will update as able,” Patel wrote.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/us/tennessee-explosion-military-accurate-energetic-systems-wwk-hnk,Tennessee military explosive plant: A massive blast at a Tennessee explosives plant obliterated a building and left 18 people missing. Here’s what we know | CNN,,,,CNN,"No one has been found alive in the search following a massive explosion at a military and explosives plant in central Tennessee, Chris Davis, sheriff of Humphreys County, said Saturday.
“We’re moving to recovery,” Davis said with emotion during a news conference one day after the blast, his voice trailing off at times. “At this time, we have recovered no survivors.”
“As we get into this, we find it even more devastating than what we thought initially,” he added.
Early Friday, the thundering blast at Accurate Energetic Systems reverberated across a tight-knit community, razing an entire building on the plant’s sprawling campus. At least 18 people were missing after the massive explosion, which rattled homes miles away and rocketed debris for at least half a square mile.
The recovery effort was being made “more volatile” with the presence of ordnance at the site, and investigators were working with the FBI to use cell phone technology to figure out what happened at the time of the explosion, Davis said.
Melissa Dawn Stanford, a 53-year-old production supervisor at the plant, is believed to have died, her niece, Brittany Kirouac, told CNN in a statement Saturday. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation informed Kirouac they don’t believe her aunt could have survived, she said.
“To say our family is devastated is to put it lightly. We are honestly at a loss for words and grief is not linear. In the past 24 hours I have seen: anger, sadness, bargaining, denial, and acceptance,” Kirouac said.
“Not only from our family, but from the families who surrounded us waiting to hear news about their loved ones,” she continued. “At this time, we are just hoping to bring her home to say goodbye.”
Kirouac asked for prayers as her family, like so many others, attempts to “navigate these coming days, weeks, and months.”
Davis said more than 300 people had searched “almost every square inch” of the plant. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ elite National Response Team, which provides a range of specialists who investigate bombings and wildfires, is part of the complicated recovery operation.
“I never want to give up hope. Hope’s always been my heart, but I don’t want to give false hope either,” Davis said.
“We need our communities to come together and understand that we’ve lost a lot of people. This don’t only affect those families, it runs deeper … this could be people that you grew up with,” Davis said, noting one victim was a childhood friend of his.
The explosion occurred during an early shift at Accurate Energetic Systems, a manufacturer of military and demolition explosives that employs scores of local residents.
“Prayers are needed … our hearts are broken for the families and for the loved ones that lost their lives,” Wendall Stinson, the manufacturer’s CEO, said alongside officials Friday.
The blast triggered a series of smaller explosions, officials said, and the cause is still under investigation.
Officials will be on site Saturday detonating explosives because “chemicals are more unstable” than previously thought, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
The source added the timing of these controlled explosions is unknown but will be audible to people in the area, noting the point is to ensure the area is safe.
Investigators are also pulling employment records, according to the source.
Here’s what we know as the investigation continues:
The explosion happened around 7:45 a.m. local time, waking residents for miles around.
“I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” Gentry Stover told The Associated Press, explaining how he was jolted awake.
It took him only moments to piece what happened together. “I live very close to Accurate (Energetic Systems), and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”
Officials said the explosion was felt as far as 15 miles away, but Cody Warren, who lives more than 20 miles from the plant, told CNN the noise woke him and at first he thought lightning had struck his house.
“I went outside and could still hear the ring of the sound off in the distance. I thought maybe it was an earthquake or a meteor explosion,” Warren told CNN.
Closer to the plant, charred debris and mangled vehicles were spread across a vast area. Davis called it “the most devastating scene that I’ve seen in my career.”
Explosion at Tennessee explosives company
Residents who find debris are being asked to call their local sheriff “so trained personnel can respond safely.” Officials are requesting everyone to avoid the area near the plant while emergency teams do their job.
It’s unclear how many people were inside the plant when the explosion happened, Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates said.
“It’s going to be an investigation that’s probably going to go on for days,” Bates said.
The ATF and Hickman and Humphreys counties’ sheriff’s offices will co-lead the investigation, which will also include the FBI, the officials said.
In a statement Friday evening, AES called the explosion a “tragic accident” and said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers, and community members affected by this incident.”
As of Friday evening, authorities were still working to contact some of the next-of-kin of employees who were believed to have been inside the building at the time of the explosion, a law enforcement source told CNN.
As part of the ongoing effort to determine which company employees may have been among the victims, the source said authorities are now also conducting analysis of records from nearby cell phone towers.
The sophisticated process involves comparing the cell phone numbers of employees with local cell phone tower registration records to help pinpoint the geographical location of a device at the time of the explosion.
Davis noted people in the community were undergoing a “gauntlet of emotions” as many awaited word of loved ones.
“I understand that some families get mad. I understand that some people get upset. … We’re doing the very best we can to take care of this,” Davis said.
18 people dead or missing after massive blast at Tennessee military explosive plant, officials say
Accurate Energetic Systems makes “various high explosive compositions and specialty products” for the US military and industrial markets, according to the company’s Facebook page. The AES plant employs around 80 people, the Hickman County mayor said.
The facility is spread across 1,300 acres in a rural, wooded area off Interstate 40, roughly 60 miles west of Nashville near the border of Hickman and Humphreys Counties, officials said.
The relatively remote area where the plant is located is typically patrolled by smaller law enforcement departments, so other agencies have volunteered resources for support, a source told CNN.
The site consists of five production buildings and “a quality lab for product evaluation and analysis,” according to a company profile from the nongovernmental Association of the United States Army, which lists AES as a sponsor.
Last month, the Department of Defense awarded AES a nearly $120 million contract “for the procurement of TNT.”
Tennessee state Sen. Kerry Roberts told CNN the company is a beloved employer for many, with workers often seen at community events sporting baseball caps with the company’s logo.
“It is a well-loved company in the area,” Roberts said. “This is going to have a devastating impact on quite a few families.”
The plant has suffered deadly accidents in the past and faced federal fines related to workplace safety practices, according to media reports and federal data.
In April 2014, an explosion at the facility killed one worker and injured four others, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. The blast, in the back of a building used for shotgun ammunition, caused severe damage. At the time, authorities said several companies operated on the property, and the explosion happened in an area run by Rio Ammunition.
Tennessee OSHA said Saturday the 2014 incident involved a different company, American Sporting Supplies, which was leasing a building at the site at that time. American Sporting Supplies no longer operates there, and Accurate Energetic Systems was not connected to the 2014 incident, according to Tennessee OSHA.
Years later, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $7,200, after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations.
The company contested the findings, OSHA records show, and eventually reached a formal settlement. Details about the inspection and its conclusion are limited, and it’s unclear if the plant has faced more recent health or safety reviews.
Records show the company has reported 46 work-related injuries since 2016, the earliest year on record. No workplace deaths were reported during this period. In 2024, the most recent year for which data is available, the company reported five injuries and one illness.
In 2021, a former employee sued the company, alleging wrongful termination after being blamed for a fire that broke out at the facility the previous year. The company disputed the claim, and the case was dropped after mediation.
The Tennessee explosion is a stark reminder of the long history of deadly workplace accidents in small-town America. That history includes the 1947 Texas City disaster , when a ship carrying ammonium nitrate exploded and killed nearly 600 people, and the 2013 fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, which killed 15 people. A wave of high-profile industrial accidents in the 1960s prompted legislative action, leading to the OSHA’s creation, signed into law by President Richard Nixon.
A small crowd gathered for a vigil Friday evening at a nearby park, holding candles as they prayed for the missing and their families, joining voices to sing “Amazing Grace,” the AP reported.
The Humphreys County sheriff said the incident struck close to home, placing a heavy strain on the tight-knit community.
“There are three families that’s involved in this that I’m very close to. When you have small counties like this, we know each other … we love each other,” Davis said.
Three individuals with “minor injuries” were treated at TriStar medical facilities in Dickson, according to a TriStar Health spokesperson. Two were discharged, while one remained under observation in an emergency room as of late Friday, the spokesperson said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/health/cdc-cuts-impacts,The CDC is facing another round of deep staff cuts,,,,CNN,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suffered another round of deep staff cuts late Friday, with disease detectives, outbreak forecasters, policy and data offices among those impacted, according to four sources with knowledge of the layoffs.
“The administration did not like that CDC data did not support their narrative, so they got rid of them. They didn’t like that CDC policy groups would not rubber stamp their unscientific ideas, so they got rid of them,” according to an agency official who asked to not be named for fear of losing their job.
The fresh round of firings came after a month after US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called for “new blood” at the agency.
“It’s imperative that we remove officials with conflicts of interest and catastrophically bad judgment, and political agendas,” Kennedy said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee in September. “We need unbiased, politics-free, transparent, evidence-based science in the public interest. Those are the guiding principles behind the changes at the CDC, and that is what you can expect all across our agency for the next three years.”
The notices were emailed shortly after 9 p.m. on a holiday weekend, following a pattern favored by the Trump administration of carrying out layoffs of federal workers outside of normal business hours. Impacted employees said the move was especially cruel during a government shutdown, which made severance information even harder to get, since many federal workers are not in their offices or able to answer emails.
White House says federal firings have begun as government shutdown drags on
President Donald Trump said late Friday afternoon that he plans to fire “a lot” of federal workers in retaliation for the government shutdown, vowing to target those deemed to be aligned with the Democratic Party .
“We figure they started this thing, so they should be Democrat-oriented,” Trump said, placing blame for the shutdown on Democratic lawmakers. Trump did not provide details on what qualified the affected workers as “Democrat-oriented.”
A court filing in that case indicates more than 4,100 federal workers were impacted by the cuts, with between 1,100 and 1,200 from HHS. As of Friday evening, RIF notices had also gone out to employees at the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security and Treasury, according to department spokespeople, union representatives and sources directly impacted.
The legality of firing federal workers during a government shutdown is also in question.  Shortly after Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted “The RIFs have begun” on X on Friday, the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents federal workers, replied “The lawsuit has been filed.”
Exact numbers of cuts to the CDC are still being assessed. Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the agency’s chief science officer and deputy director of program and science, said that in January, the CDC had 13,674 employees. Before Friday’s cuts, there were 11,400. With about 1,100 projected cuts, it will be around 10,300, she said.
The CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, which trains the agency’s celebrated “disease detectives,” lost at least 30 of its staff who coordinate the program, and 40 EIS officers who were in their second year of training, according to a second agency official who asked to not be named for fear of retaliation. The EIS had been spared in a previous round of cuts carried out in April.
More than 130 employees were laid off from the office of the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, which coordinated activities for the entire center, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as the director of the NCIRD.
Measles outbreaks across the US continue to add to record case count
The layoffs come as the country is heading into the winter respiratory virus season – a time when infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and Covid-19 cause a surge in hospitalizations and deaths. The cuts mean there will be fewer experts keeping tabs on the severity of the season and which cities and states are most impacted.
“The damage is beyond repair,” Daskalakis said. “Crippling CDC, even as a ploy to create political pressure to end the government shut down, means America is even less prepared for outbreaks and infectious disease security threats.”
All the staff at the agency’s the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a journal known as the MMWR that has published surveillance data on the nation’s health for more than a century, were also fired, according to Houry.
“It’s not radically transparent if the agency can’t communicate. Cutting things like MMWR will prevent scientists from communicating about urgent clinical and scientific issues,” Houry said.
There were also cuts to support staff, including people who arrange travel and security for CDC scientists working on international outbreaks. The agency’s Office of Safety Security and Asset Management was also impacted, despite staff there recently receiving praise for preventing a gunman from accessing the campus during shooting in August that killed DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and left several campus buildings pocked with hundreds of bullet holes."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/weather/noreaster-storm-east-coast-flooding-winds-climate,Weekend nor’easter threatens major coastal flooding and damaging winds along East Coast,,,,CNN,"A nasty coastal storm, known as a nor’easter , is organizing off the Southeast US and is poised to deliver tropical storm-force wind gusts, soaking rain and dangerous seas up most of the East Coast into early next week.
The storm will pack a serious punch as it strengthens and moves north. Water levels along the New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia coasts could rise to levels not seen in nearly a decade. The major coastal flooding could inundate roads and homes and cause beach erosion alongside the heavy rain and potentially damaging wind.
It could become an air travel nightmare for major hubs like Washington, DC, New York City and Boston with strong winds likely causing delays and cancellations by Monday.
A state of emergency will go into effect for New Jersey Saturday night ahead of the storm’s worst impacts, acting Gov. Tahesha Way announced Friday.
“I urge all New Jerseyans to exercise caution, monitor local weather forecasts and warnings, stay informed on evacuation protocols, and remain off the roads unless absolutely necessary,” Way said in a statement.
The nor’easter already caused some impacts: It drove the highest tides of the month even higher on Friday in parts of the Southeast. Officials in Charleston, South Carolina, made multiple city parking garages free while urging people in low-lying areas to move their vehicles as ocean water flowed onto land .
A significant coastal flooding event will unfold from the Outer Banks through the Northeast with tide levels this weekend just shy of their highest marks of the month. The combination of soaking rain and strong winds pushing water onshore will be potent: Dozens of coastal spots from North Carolina to New York are expected to reach moderate-to-major flood stage from this nor’easter.
In Delaware and New Jersey, particularly the southern part of the state, coastal flooding could get bad enough to cause some roads to become impassible and some structures to flood, according to the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey.
Water levels could rise above 8 feet Atlantic City, New Jersey — the highest level since Sandy in 2012 — and enter major flood stage on Sunday afternoon. That’s enough to trigger widespread flooding of roads in the area with some neighborhoods potentially becoming cut off due to the water, according to NOAA .
The nor’easter will also drive turbulent seas and generate rough surf that will make swimming dangerous for hundreds of miles of coastline.
Up to half a foot of rain could fall near the North Carolina coast this weekend starting Saturday, paired with gusty winds up to 45 mph. The nor’easter will also contribute to ongoing beach erosion in the state’s Outer Banks, where at least nine unoccupied homes have collapsed into the Atlantic since September 30 due to intense wave action and erosion from recent storms.
Disruptive weather will reach farther north Sunday and Monday with a few inches of rain possible along the rest of the mid-Atlantic coast and into southern New England. Any areas caught under multiple rounds of this drenching rain could see localized flash flooding.
Climate change is supercharging the winds of the strongest Nor’easters, a recent study found, and this one will be no slouch.
Powerful winds, with possible prolonged gusts of 40 to 50 mph, will accompany this rain. Winds will max out later Saturday into Sunday for much of the Southeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic coast. New Jersey and southern New England will feel some of the strongest gusts — up to 60 mph — Sunday into Monday. These wind gusts are as strong as what a tropical storm produces, despite this system not being one.
Power outages are possible as these strong winds batter coastal areas. Less powerful, but still noticeable winds should also stretch further inland to more heavily populated areas.
After the storm moves away from the coast later Monday into Tuesday, the East could get a brief reprieve from the dreary weather. Then, yet another batch of unseasonable heat is expected to set in by late next week."

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/politics/kilmar-abrego-garcia-deportation-court-hearings,Kilmar Abrego Garcia: 3 African countries say they won’t accept him as battle plays out in two courts over his fate,,,,CNN,"Officials from three different African nations have said they won’t let the US deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to their countries, potentially frustrating the Trump administration’s plans to keep him in custody.
The rejections – two of which were revealed by a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official in a Maryland courtroom on Friday – could lead a federal judge to order the administration to release Abrego Garcia from immigration custody for now, if she decides that his deportation does not appear imminent.
The countries – Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana – have said at various points in recent weeks that they would not allow Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man unlawfully deported to El Salvador in mid-March and later brought back to the US to face human smuggling charges, to be put on a plane and sent to their territories.
Under a 2019 court order, US officials are barred from sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, his home country, which he fled years earlier amid threats of gang violence.
US District Judge Paula Xinis did not rule Friday on the request from Abrego Garcia to be released from the detention facility he’s being held at in Pennsylvania. But in a lengthy hearing, she appeared at times to be unconvinced that the government had shown a compelling reason to keep him detained.
The hearing was the latest episode in Abrego Garcia’s ongoing attempt to get courts to intervene in his immigration case to ensure the Trump administration doesn’t run roughshod over his due process rights months after he was wrongly deported.
Several states away on Friday, another set of attorneys for Abrego Garcia went before a federal judge in Nashville to sort out how much they can pry into the Trump administration’s innerworkings as they seek to have his criminal charges thrown out based on their claim that he’s being unfairly prosecuted.
His team told US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw that they will ask him in the coming days to force federal prosecutors to hand over communications from senior Justice Department officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as part of the court-ordered fact-finding process that will help buttress their bid to get the case dismissed.
Prosecutors say the decision to indict Abrego Garcia rested with Tennessee’s acting US Attorney Robert McGuire and that McGuire was not influenced by Trump administration officials.
“Any communications between senior government actors themselves about this case, but which did not influence the Acting United States Attorney because they did not reach him or were not communicated to him (i.e. not “tied to the actual decisionmaker”), would not be discoverable,” the government wrote in court papers this week.
In Greenbelt, Maryland, ICE official John Schultz spent hours testifying about what steps the Trump administration has taken or will soon take to re-deport Abrego Garcia.
But while Xinis appeared to view his testimony as largely unhelpful, Schultz’s revelations about what officials from Uganda and Eswatini have told the Trump administration showed that the government has run into major issues with finding a third country that will accept Abrego Garcia.
After he was released from pre-trial custody in Tennessee this summer, immigration officials notified Abrego Garcia of their intention to deport him to Uganda. He quickly said that he feared being sent there due to a fear of facing torture or persecution, and officials later told him they were planning to send him to Eswatini.
“How did it change from Uganda to Eswatini?” Sascha Rand, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, asked at one point.
“My understanding is that Uganda ultimately said ‘no,’” Schultz replied.
At another point during his testimony, Schultz said that he was told that US officials first asked Eswatini if they would be willing to accept Abrego Garcia this week and that as of Friday morning, the country had said they wouldn’t allow for his removal there.
But, Schultz added, discussions with Eswatini are “ongoing.”
At times, Xinis, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, appeared annoyed by Schultz’s inability to provide answers to some basic questions about what the administration is doing to remove Abrego Garcia a second time from the US. She compared his testimony to some that was given earlier this year.
“We have the same problem today,” Xinis said. “Three strikes and you’re out.”
This summer, after Abrego Garcia objected to being sent to Uganda, he designated Costa Rica as the country he’d prefer to be deported to. The Central American country has said that it would accept him and give him some form of legal status.
That decision featured prominently in Friday’s hearing, with Xinis repeatedly questioning why the officials hadn’t committed to sending him there.
On Thursday, officials noted their intention to send Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but quickly disavowed that plan the same day. Hours before the hearing started Friday, an official from the African nation said on social media that it, too, would not accept a US plan to send him there.
Those three rejections, an attorney for Abrego Garcia told Xinis, made clear that there was no good reason for the government’s continued detention of their client.
“This game that they’re effectively playing of naming one country after another, having them say, ‘No thank you,’ … I think that what that shows is the real aim of the government – and an improper one – is just to keep him incarcerated,” the attorney, Andrew Rossman, said.
In Nashville, attorneys for Abrego Garcia told Crenshaw it’s possible federal agents failed to properly read their client his Miranda rights after his arrest in March, when he was taken into custody and sent days later on a plane to El Salvador.
They said they plan to file several motions – including over possible coercion from the agents – to suppress statements Abrego Garcia made when he was detained.
They also told Crenshaw they plan to file motions to remove language from the indictment they say is unrelated to the human smuggling charges, including claims their client is part of the notorious MS-13 gang.
“Agents with Homeland Security stopped our client, detained him,” and conducted a “custodial interview,” defense attorney Jenna Dabbs told the judge Friday. They did so, Dabbs said, without probable cause and may have coerced Abrego Garcia and never warned him of his rights to remain silent or be represented by an attorney before interviewing him.
Accusations that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13 have been touted by Homeland Security, Justice Department and White House officials, including President Donald Trump, who once showed an image of Abrego Garcia’s hand tattoos, arguing they represented the letters and numbers “MS-13.”
In a major ruling last week, Crenshaw said that Abrego Garcia had “sufficiently presented some evidence that the Government had a stake in retaliating against him” after he successfully challenged his unlawful deportation earlier this year.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/sport/sports-fans-behaving-badly-analysis,‘It happens at every game’: Why the stands at sporting events can sometimes feel like battlegrounds,,,,CNN,"EDITOR’S NOTE: “Bad Sports: When Fans Turn Violent” airs on Saturday, October 11 at 8pm ET on “The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper”.
If you’re a sports fan there’s nothing quite like the Fall season on the calendar.
Football is tightening its grip on our attention. The drama of playoff baseball is intensifying. The dawn of new basketball and hockey seasons are upon us as well. And if you prefer the kind of football played with your feet, you’ll find the passionate singing of international soccer fans filling stadiums around the world.
But with this sports-inspired passion comes an all-too-common drama also where millions of fans find so much joy. Every week provides viral moments captured on cellphones of sports fans behaving badly, often erupting into life-altering brawls and chaos.
In September, Anthony Thomas left the first NFL game of this season celebrating his team’s “big victory.”  Just outside the stadium where his hometown Washington Commanders beat the rival New York Giants, he heard a “commotion” erupt behind him.
Thomas saw two men – wearing Commanders’ jerseys – unleashing a flurry of punches on another man in a blue Giants shirt.
The crack of punches hitting the Giants fan can be heard on the cellphone video Thomas captured that afternoon. A young woman and a security guard stepped in to pull the two Commanders fans off the Giants fan who had fallen to the ground. One of the men wearing a Commanders jersey leaves the scene with blood on his face.
As quickly as the fight started, it seemed to evaporate just as fast.
Thomas doesn’t know what sparked the fight, but he says it’s just become part of the experience of attending a professional football game.
“It happens at every game. Every single game,” said Thomas.
Thomas is a high-profile chef in Washington, D.C. He has a growing social media presence and makes routine appearances on television cooking segments and even competed in a Food Network show called “Battle of the Brothers” in 2021.
Four years ago, Thomas started noticing the changing dynamic of sports fans at games. That’s when he decided to start taking his own personal security officer to every football game. Thomas acknowledges this “sounds crazy” but he calls the 6-foot-7, 310-pound hired security officer an insurance policy.
“There’s always one or two fans that are looking to impede on everyone else’s fun and try to find a way, if they have the losing team, to try to ruin the morale that’s going on in the stadium,” said Thomas.
Over the last year, I’ve embarked on a journey to explore why so many sports fans turn into neanderthal spectators in the heat of athletic battle.
We are there to admire the feats of the world’s premier athletes. We fill stadiums in our favorite team’s colors and jerseys and cheer young men and women who have reached the pinnacle of their sport. But the experience too often triggers barbaric rage.
To help explore the answer this question, I turned to Bill Buford the author of “Among the Thugs” – one of my favorite sports books. Buford spent years immersing himself in the world of British hooligan soccer syndicates. He befriended a wild cast of characters that wreak havoc at soccer venues around Europe.
“Being in a crowd at a live sporting event is one of the great dramas of human civilization that has been rarely understood and appreciated,” Buford told me in a London pub just blocks away from the Chelsea Football Club’s home stadium. “It is high theater without a script.”
Buford traveled to games with British hooligans to understand the mind of a violent crowd. He witnessed gruesome fighting and fans crushed by mobs. His book is raw and jarring.
There’s a scene where a hooligan bites the eye out of a police officer during a fight. In those days, Buford came to have a sixth sense of when a sports crowd was “about to go off” and spark “wild anarchic power.”
“Big crowds are capable of so much power, so much destruction,” said Buford. “If you have a unified crowd, there’s a moment when you realize how powerful you are. And it’s very hard to stop a crowd.”
Buford wanted to understand the psychology of what lures people – usually men – to feed into the violence inspired by a sporting event. And what he found is that in the rush of attending sporting events, there’s a connection and emotional transformation that takes place.
“There is a nationalism that arises out of loyalty to your side,” said Buford.
A few weeks ago, Joey Cromwell settled into his seat to watch the Cincinnati Bengals and Jacksonville Jaguars football game, he didn’t expect a seat in row 32 to get him too close to the action. It seemed like a perfectly safe distance from which to watch massive gladiators violently blocking and tackling each other.
But at the end of the third quarter, a brawl between fans erupted two rows behind him and one of those fans was pushed into his lap. By the time the 40-year-old Bengals fan turned around and realized what was happening, his cellphone camera recorded a group of men throwing punches.
“My wife, she actually, took off running because she was so scared. She’s like, ‘I don’t know what’s about to happen, but I’m getting the hell out of here,’” said Cromwell. “We spent a lot of money for those tickets. I literally had somebody fall on me.”
Cromwell said the fight started with spectators arguing over someone standing up and blocking the view of the game for other fans. As Cromwell described what happened and how the tussle seemed to last nearly 10 minutes, you can tell he has a hard time believing something so trivial became so dramatic.
“I’m like, ‘Really? This is what they’re fighting over? Oh wait, this is really serious. They’re really fighting,’” said Cromwell.
After it all ended, Cromwell said an elderly couple sitting in the same rows were visibly terrified by what happened. Most of the fighting fans seemed to be escorted away from the section The scene returned to normal, and Cromwell said everyone went back to simply praying for the Bengals to win.
I’ve thought about the fights I’ve witnessed at sporting events over the years and reflected about my conversation with Buford. Surely alcohol plays a factor, to a certain degree, but I sense there’s something else going on.
We fill stadiums to watch sporting events where success is often measured by toughness and the ability to inflict pain on your opponent or overpower them in battle. And many of those players on the field are our heroes.
Some of us sitting there as spectators absorb that mentality. Walking away from a fight or turning the other cheek at someone hurling insults your way would be an insult to our own ego and pride. And in these moments, it doesn’t take much to spark the flame of violence.
“If you allow yourself to do violence, it’s a little bit like a person jumping off a diving board, or jumping out of a window, or it’s like you’re lurching into no rules. Anything goes. You know you’re doing something you shouldn’t do, and there’s this exhilarating moment of like the leap,” Buford said.
And once a sports fan takes that leap into violence, Buford says, you cross a civil threshold, you are airborne and there’s no coming back."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/world/netanyahu-trump-ceasefire-analysis-intl,Trump cornered Netanyahu. But he also might have saved him,,,,CNN,"In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, Donald Trump reigns supreme. Banners proclaiming “We love Trump” offer effusive thanks to the US president. For the families of the Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas in Gaza, and the crowds who supported their struggle over two years, the narrative is clear: with the imminent return of the hostages, Trump delivered what Benjamin Netanyahu wouldn’t.
Or couldn’t.
For months, the accusation against the Israeli prime minister has been consistent. The hostage families and Netanyahu’s political opponents believe he prolonged the war in Gaza for his political survival. The military campaign appeased his far-right coalition partners, who called to expand Israel’s assault on Gaza and dreamed of fully re-occupying the territory.
“Netanyahu isn’t willing to pay the political price of bringing back all the hostages,” opposition leader Yair Lapid charged last December.
But the landscape shifted dramatically with Trump’s return to the White House early in 2025.
Netanyahu has described Trump as the best friend Israel has ever had in the Oval Office. The prime minister previously scored political points feuding with democratic administrations in the United States. He wouldn’t dare do that with Trump. And Trump has used that leverage when he needs to.
In January, the US president exerted decisive pressure on Netanyahu to accept a deal that brought 30 of the living hostages and eight deceased hostages home. It was Joe Biden’s ceasefire plan, but Trump pushed Netanyahu to accept.
In June, during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, Trump ordered Israel to call off an imminent airstrike, posting an order on Truth Social: “BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME NOW.” The fighter jets turned around in mid-air.
Last week, Trump’s leverage was on display again as he forced Netanyahu into an unprecedented apology to Qatar over the failed September 9 strike on Hamas leaders in Doha. The apology included a humiliating visual of the call from the Oval Office which was posted on social media for the world to see.
Then Trump announced his ambitious 20-point plan to end the war entirely during Netanyahu’s Washington visit.
Trump says hostages being retrieved ‘now’ as aid trucks start entering Gaza
After Hamas said it was ready to negotiate, Trump explicitly directed Israel to halt bombing in Gaza, while deeming the US-designated terrorist organization as “ready for lasting peace.”
Then he dispatched his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner  to Cairo to secure a deal, and finally announced on Wednesday night that “peace” is underway, with all 48 remaining hostages  expected to be released  under the agreement’s first phase.
Netanyahu, for his part, repeatedly rejects claims that he succumbed to US pressure. He tried to frame the ceasefire deal as a milestone of unprecedented strategic coordination, selling it as “one of our great achievements” in a two-year war that has wrought devastation and more than 67,000 deaths in Gaza, according to authorities there.
“Anyone who says that this hostage deal was always on the table is simply not telling the truth,” he said in a televised statement on Friday.
Contrary to previous Hamas demands, Trump’s plan ensures the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) maintains a presence over roughly half of the embattled enclave. Netanyahu pitches this as a win : hostages returned, IDF holding ground, Hamas weakened.
Yet it falls short from the “total victory” he pledged for two years. The first phase leaves Hamas armed and operational, doesn’t guarantee disarmament or leadership exile, and Gaza’s post-war governance remains undefined.
Yet the man who was cornered into a ceasefire may have also been granted an escape route from a protracted, unpopular war ahead of the Israeli elections set for next year.
According to two Israeli officials, Netanyahu was one of the authors of Trump’s 20-point proposal.
According to these officials, after Israel’s short  war with Iran in June, Trump and Netanyahu agreed, “Once Iran was hit, Gaza had to end.”
While negotiators shuttled to Doha for another round of failed talks, Netanyahu’s closest confidant, Ron Dermer, worked parallel channels with the Trump administration and Gulf states on what eventually became Trump’s ceasefire blueprint.
“The final plan is full of Dermer’s fingerprints,” one of the sources said, while admitting that in the final stretch Trump imposed terms Netanyahu had to accept, including a potential pathway to a Palestinian state.
Critically, Netanyahu appeared to structure a deal which includes his favorite escape hatch. Trump’s grandiose peace plan still ended up phased and conditional – granting the Israeli leader political leeway with his hardline coalition.
Zohran Mamdani opens the door to praising Trump for Israel-Hamas deal
Full IDF withdrawal is contingent on Hamas disarmament, according to the agreement, a deliberately ambiguous trigger that Netanyahu says preserves Israel’s freedom to resume fighting, while Hamas officials claim they have US assurances that the war will not resume.
As veteran Israeli journalist Nahum Barnea wrote on Friday in Yedioth Ahronoth, the agreement “has more holes than Swiss cheese” and “more willingness to agree than instructions for implementation.”
This ambiguity is what keeps Netanyahu’s coalition intact, at least temporarily. Despite far-right threats to overthrow the government, right-wing ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have signaled they are staying, soothed by Netanyahu’s assurances that “the war isn’t over” and that Israel reserves the right to resume fighting if Hamas fails to disarm.
Netanyahu may have been cornered to end the war, but he engineered enough wiggle room to claim that he hasn’t.
His decision was also shaped by the looming political calendar. Israel’s next elections are officially scheduled for October 2026, but it appears increasingly unlikely it will be  that long. An Israeli source told CNN that “several months ago, Netanyahu realized the war had become a liability, and he didn’t want to head into elections with hostages still captive, serving as a daily reminder of the October 7 failure.”
Netanyahu’s main challenge in the next election will be responsibility for the deadliest day in Israel’s history, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were kidnapped to Gaza. Two years ago, Netanyahu appeared to be politically dead, given that  catastrophic failure that happened on his watch. A majority of Israelis supported his resignation, while weekly protests have called for elections.
Twin brothers, childhood friends and IDF soldiers: Who are the hostages still held in Gaza?
Trump handed Netanyahu a new narrative for political redemption.
Ending the war will offer the Israeli leader  relief from daily headlines of IDF casualties, strained reservist forces, increasing international isolation and severe economic damage –  heavy burdens for electoral campaigns. And as Trump repeatedly notes, the ceasefire is extremely popular. Though detailed polling on the electoral impact of the deal is pending, previous surveys repeatedly suggest 60 to 70%  of Israelis support it.
“Bibi told me, I can’t believe it. Everybody’s liking me now,” Trump said in an interview to Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Wednesday, recounting a phone call with Netanyahu. “More importantly, they’re loving Israel again.”
Netanyahu’s campaign is already taking shape: the war is over, the hostages are home, Iran and its proxies are degraded, and with Trump by his side, he will try to expand regional normalization.
Netanyahu is keenly aware of Trump’s popularity in Israel – much greater than his own – and sources say he intends to make him central for his  election campaign. In an extraordinary move, Netanyahu invited Kushner and Witkoff to the Israeli cabinet meeting on Thursday, in which the ceasefire deal was approved.
Next week, Trump himself arrives in Israel to participate in the celebrations. Netanyahu is likely to orchestrate every moment for maximum political impact and ride Trump’s popularity straight into the election.
Pressure from the US might have forced Netanyahu to accept terms he spent months avoiding, yet by making Trump the story – the savior dealmaker who loves Israel – Netanyahu will try to carry out political alchemy, converting the deal into political gold. It may also distract from the prime minister’s long-running corruption trial that Trump, incidentally, has called to be thrown out.
Whether Trump’s endorsement can rewrite Netanyahu’s legacy as the prime minister who presided over Israel’s worst security failure and longest war will become an ultimate test of Israeli voters’ memory."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/politics/joe-biden-radiation-therapy-cancer,Biden starts radiation therapy to treat prostate cander,,,,CNN,"Joe Biden has started radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, a spokesperson for the former president told CNN.
“As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,” the spokesperson said.
The news was first reported by NBC News . A spokesperson for the former president, who turns 83 next month, did not give a timeline for the treatment. A source told CNN he began the treatment a few weeks ago.
Biden’s personal office revealed in May that he had been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.
“The expectation is we’re going to be able to beat this,” Biden told CNN in his first comments about the diagnosis two weeks after he received it. “It’s not in any organ, it’s in – my bones are strong, it hadn’t penetrated. So, I’m feeling good.”
He added that he started a pill regimen to treat the cancer.
“Prostate cancer is very common,” Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine, who is not involved in Biden’s treatment, told CNN in May. “As we get older, most men are going to have little cancer cells in them.”
Prostate cancers can be assigned a grade, known as a Gleason score, based on what the cells look like under a microscope. Biden’s office announced in May a Gleason score of 9 , “the most aggressive form of prostate cancer,” Dr. Benjamin Davies, a professor of urologic oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who is also not involved in Biden’s case, told CNN at the time.
Besides the Gleason score, factors like blood prostate-specific antigen levels, imaging tests and biopsy findings are important in determining how the cancer might behave and what treatment options would be best.
Even patients with high-risk prostate cancer “can live a pretty normal life and have a good quality of life, as long as the cancer is treated,” Brahmbhatt said. That treatment is personalized to each patient and might come in several forms, such as hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiation.
The fact that Biden’s cancer had spread to the bone “is very serious and not curable,” Davies said. However, “There is some good news here in the newer hormonal and chemotherapy therapies (that have come) into this space in the past few years which have shown impressive results and extended the longevity of patients significantly.”
Last month, Biden had Mohs surgery , an operation used to remove skin cancer lesions. In that procedure, thin layers of skin are removed and examined under a microscope until the doctor sees no signs of skin cancer cells. It’s typically used to treat cancerous lesions that have returned after previous treatment, are fast-growing, or are in important areas like the face, hands or genitals.
In 2023 while president , Biden had a lesion removed from his chest, which later tested positive for basal cell carcinoma. At the time, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as Biden’s physician in the White House, said “all cancerous tissue was successfully removed” and Biden would continue “dermatological surveillance.”
Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It’s slow-growing and usually curable.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/sport/basketball-wnba-finals-aja-wilson-intl,A’ja Wilson confirms status as generational great with historic WNBA Finals performance,,,,CNN,"A’ja Wilson stood inside a circle of her Las Vegas Aces teammates on Friday, playing a tambourine. The superstar center was orchestrating the celebrations, just as she had orchestrated the performance that preceded them and, increasingly, the Aces’ dynasty itself.
She contributed to practically every aspect of the Aces’ third WNBA title in four years – the talisman, finisher, creator and leader all rolled into one.
“You have your Mount Rushmore, she’s alone on Everest,” Aces coach Becky Hammon said afterwards, per the Associated Press. “There’s no one around.”
No one else in WNBA history has ever been named MVP, Finals MVP and Defensive Player in the same year. Even at a time when stars are proliferating across the league and when the quality of play is better than it has ever been, Wilson is still undeniably the best.
For Hammon, “the skill set and the level” her team are at “is not comparable” to previous dynasties in WNBA history like the Houston Comets – who won four consecutive titles in 1997-2000 – and the Minnesota Lynx –who won four titles between 2011 and 2017.
“I think these ladies are at the top of the game, and it is the best basketball that the W has ever seen from top to bottom,” she told reporters.
And within this golden age of the WNBA, there is Wilson. Even just her stats from the Finals make for extraordinary reading. She contributed 31 points and nine rebounds in Friday’s Game 4, sunk the game-winner in Wednesday’s Game 3, and became the first player in WNBA Finals history to record three consecutive games with 25 or more points and 10 rebounds.
But her influence runs deeper than that. There was a time this season when the Aces were almost dismissed as title contenders. They started the season 12-13, a sign, perhaps, of their failing powers after they had exited the playoffs in the semifinals last year. Then came a record 53-point defeat against Minnesota at home.
Wilson, according to ESPN, sent her teammates a text which read: “If you weren’t embarrassed from yesterday, then don’t come into this gym. You’re not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing.”
She “check(ed) on every single person,” teammate NaLyssa Smith recalled to ESPN. “You would think a person that’s a four-time MVP, with all these accomplishments, would really care just about moving themselves to the top. But (she) pours so much into other people.”
After that, the Aces went on a 16-game winning streak, during which Wilson averaged a remarkable 26.1 points, 12 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.3 blocks and 1.6 steals.
Wilson is still only 29 years old and already has won four MVP awards – more than any other player – and two Finals MVP awards.
“Greatness is, like I said, just being patient, waiting on your turn, waiting on your moment,” she told reporters afterward. “I think that’s what defines us is you’ve got to be great when the lights aren’t on you. You’ve got to be great when nobody’s in the gym with you. You’ve got to be great when you may not get anything on the end.
“That is what greatness is to me because that is consistency and that is just you doing the right things because it’s right. So I think that’s how I would redefine it, and I think that’s what you saw in this group. We had times where it was tested, battle tested, but like our plants, we just needed to grow with a little bit more sunshine, a little bit more water.”
As for whether the Aces can continue building their dynasty, that is still unclear. The future of this team is uncertain, as much is across the WNBA right now with the league’s collective bargaining agreement expiring at the end of October. And, because of that, most players timed their contracts to expire at the end of this season too, meaning that there will be 123 free agents this offseason, according to Spotrac .
For the Aces, much depends on whether stars like Wilson, Jewell Loyd and Chelsea Gray will recommit to the franchise.
But, for the moment, the Aces are focusing on what they have already built, the celebrations, and the tambourine.
“I know everybody’s laughing that (the tambourine is) funny, and it is funny and it’s cute and it’s pink, but this is a symbol of just the joyfulness we have right now, and I’m grateful to be with this bunch,” Wilson said. “That ain’t the alcohol talking.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/politics/obama-democracy-warnings-trump,Obama’s warnings about democracy fading increasingly sound directed toward the US,,,,CNN,"Speaking with democracy activists recently from Hungary and Poland, former President Barack Obama warned about the “rising wave of authoritarianism sweeping the globe,” even in countries once believed unsusceptible to an erosion of liberties.
“We’re seeing politicians target civil society, undermine freedom of the press, weaponize the justice system,” Obama went on. “And no one is being spared. Even countries that thought they were immune from wholesale assaults on democracy now understand that we’re all part of one struggle.”
Obama didn’t mention his successor by name. But he’s taken an outspoken posture against President Donald Trump throughout a series of public appearances this year, amping up his criticism of Trump’s second term and expressing concern about the state of American politics.
The panelists Obama spoke with at an event last month previously participated in the Obama Foundation’s young leaders program. They were Sándor Léderer, who co-founded an anti-corruption watchdog ground in Hungary; Stefania Kapronczay, who until recently served as co-director of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union; and Zuzanna Rudzinska-Bluszcz, who served as the Deputy Justice Minister for Poland from December 2023 to August 2025.
“I’ve become increasingly concerned about the rising wave of authoritarianism sweeping the globe,” Obama said in a video introducing the conversation, which took place in London.
The comments were a veiled, if clear, rebuke of not only the current US administration but also some of the leaders Trump has aligned himself with since taking office.
Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is a champion of what he calls “illiberal democracy,” and is often credited with inspiring Trump’s playbook for government . Orbán has become a darling to MAGA conservatives, and the president has praised him as a “very great leader” and “very strong man.”
In Poland, meanwhile, a firebrand aligned with the right-wing populist Law and Justice party narrowly won the country’s presidential election in June, a political upset that could torpedo the centrist government’s efforts to unspool the legacy of authoritarianism in the country.
Trump has tried to deploy military assets to Democratic-led cities against their leaders’ wishes, urged the Justice Department to bring indictments against his political rivals and lashed out at judges who attempt to block his actions.
Obama didn’t raise any of those examples specifically. But he pointed to promises — empty ones, in his view — offered by politicians to “go back to the way things were” that hewed closely to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” message.
At the same time, the former president offered an acknowledgment that sclerotic bureaucracies and unresponsive politicians had, in many ways, ushered in a global populist wave.
“In the United States, for example, there will need to be laws that are changed so that action can be taken more effectively, more quickly to respond to problems in a lawful way,” Obama said during his discussion. “I think what we’ve seen is that when people are frustrated, they’re willing to take any action, even if it’s unlawful, because at least there’s a sense of, something’s happening. That’s something that I think everybody has to internalize at this point.”
He acknowledged that centrist politicians had, in many instances, lost the pulse of voters and allowed some of the populist anger to take hold.
“A big challenge is that the governments themselves, whether center-right or center-left, were losing touch with people and weren’t delivering on some of the basic hopes and dreams of people, so you get frustrated with government, period,” he said. “That obviously then opens the door for right-wing populism, anti-immigrant sentiment, anger, grievances.”
He said wealth gaps and a complex modern economies had left people feeling “as if they don’t have control, and they feel as if their politicians often don’t have control over all the different forces there.” And he said social media was “very good at making people fearful of or angry about those who don’t agree with them.”
“We haven’t figured out, all right, what are the new forms of participation that can engage people and make them feel empowered so that when they act, it’s going to make a difference for them and their families,” he said.
And he suggested authoritarians operate “just by breaking things” instead of building new alternatives to the systems they decry.
“They can tear things down, remove constraints on their actions, and empower themselves in a small group,” he said. “In terms of being able to solve some of the big problems around health care or education, there, not so much, because that does require creating new structures. It’s not just a matter of getting a cut, taking a piece of whatever is being done and making sure your friends are rewarded and your enemies are punished.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/melania-trump-putin-ukraine-russia,"Melania Trump says she has an ‘open channel’ to Putin on Ukrainian children, and some have been reunited with family",,,,CNN,"First lady Melania Trump said Friday that Russia has allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents, following months of private discussions between Russian officials and the first lady’s office centered on children separated from their families during the war.
The first lady revealed that she and Russian President Vladimir Putin have had an “open channel” of communication since she wrote him a letter in August about the impact of the war in Ukraine on kids. She said the eight children were all returned to their families over the last 24 hours, with a commitment that the two sides will continue to work toward reunifying additional children displaced as part of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“This remains an ongoing effort,” Melania Trump said in a brief speech at the White House. “Plans are already underway to reunify more children in the immediate future. I hope peace will come soon. It can begin with our children.”
The first lady’s announcement comes as the Trump administration, however, has cut funding to a leading organization that tracks evidence of Russian war crimes, including the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.
The Ukraine Conflict Observatory was run by Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab and established with State Department backing in 2022 “to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.”
The group produced reports on a slew of alleged Russian war crimes, including the extent of Moscow’s efforts to relocate, re-educate, and sometimes militarily train or forcibly adopt out Ukrainian children.
Privately influential but publicly absent, Melania Trump is picking and choosing her moments this term
Their database included the information and identities of over 30,000 Ukrainian children who were allegedly abducted by Russia across 100 locations, according to a source familiar with the data.
The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for the alleged war crime of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children.
As CNN reported in March, the administration terminated financial support for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory. Funding was temporarily restored later that month to allow the repository of evidence on the alleged Russian war crimes to be sent to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol.
Researchers have lost access to evidence of alleged Russian war crimes following Trump admin funding cut
In June, a group of lawmakers called on the State Department to disburse approximately $8 million that the agency told Congress in late 2024 would be used to support the Ukraine Conflict Observatory’s work. Two congressional aides said at the time that to their knowledge, the funding has not been disbursed.
The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab has raised enough money through private donations to continue their work until January 1, their executive director said, but they don’t know what will happen after that.
President Donald Trump hand-delivered a “peace” letter on behalf of the first lady to Putin in August . The letter did not specifically reference the thousands of Ukrainian children who have allegedly been abducted by Russia since the war began, but urged Putin to consider the impact the conflict was having on children in general.
Putin responded to Melania Trump in writing, the first lady said Friday, offering details about the Ukrainian children in Russia and offering to talk directly about the issue.
“Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children,” Melania Trump said. “We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war.”
In addition to releasing the eight children, Melania Trump said that Russian officials have provided updates on the identities of some children and the social and medical services that they’re receiving. She added that she’s also pressed the country over those Ukrainians who were minors when the war started, but are now adults and still residing in Russia. Russian officials have agreed to work toward rejoining those adults in the near future, Melania Trump said.
“My ongoing mission is twofold: To optimize a transparent free-flow exchange of health-related information surrounding all children who have (fallen) victim to this war,” Trump said, “and to facilitate the regular reunification of children with their families until each individual returns home.”
In a social media post Saturday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said that his country is “deeply grateful” to the first lady for her “compassion and genuine involvement in the effort to bring Ukrainian children back home.”
“Yet there is still so much work ahead. Every day, Russia’s war takes more innocent lives,” he said, naming seven-year-old Makar Dorosh, who was killed in an airstrike in Zaporizhzhia on Friday, as an example of this.
“Thousands of others remain in danger: deported, trafficked, indoctrinated, stripped of their identity, or forced to live under constant threat of attack — all robbed of their childhoods,” he said.
“Russia is the architect of this tragedy. And it must bear full responsibility for every life taken, every child stolen, and every childhood destroyed,” Yermak added.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/health/male-gaze-wellness,"The male gaze: It’s back, and it’s coming for everyone",,,,CNN,"This summer, I got cultural whiplash.
As a child of the ’90s and early 2000s, I grew up with my mother’s and grandmother’s generations’ fight for legal and workplace equality helping shed social misogyny.
In the past decade in particular, I saw the evidence of progress in my media diet. The movies, shows, books and advertisements I consumed were increasingly giving women a seat at the table. Heroin chic fell away, and body positivity entered the fashion world. Stories about a woman stealing your man were traded for celebration of the “girl’s girl” who resisted the competition for men’s attention.
And when my husband and I got married earlier this year, our vision of what our life could be included wide-ranging possibilities, influenced in part by the movies and shows we grew up with. We saw, read and listened to stories of involved fathers, successful mothers and well-matched partners who supported one another.
It seemed like women were taking a deeper breath without such heavy cultural restrictions.
Here’s how women are empowering others around the world
Then there was a shift.
Was it around the 2024 presidential election? Or since the overturn of Roe v. Wade? Maybe when men’s rights activists pushed back against #MeToo? Whatever the catalyst, a change in the political environment seemed to connect with a social change that brought back narrow, and at times constrictive, ideas of womanhood depicted in media.
The recent rise of weight loss medications coincided with social media influencers sharing ways to get smaller and no longer celebrating bodies of all sizes. Advertisements followed suit, making men’s desire once again a dominating factor in how stories are told, and how women are portrayed.
How had these discarded ideas made their way back into circulation? Didn’t we all agree we were through with them?
The culprit, I have learned, is the male gaze. It was always there, but now it has stepped back into the spotlight.
The male gaze came roaring back this summer.
American Eagle –– whose partner brand Aerie has been known for marketing underwear to women with imagery that celebrated stretch marks, cellulite and a range of body sizes — ran a controversial ad campaign starting in July. The ads sell jeans to women featuring actor Sydney Sweeney, who many men see as a sex symbol, insinuating the clothing would make men find them more attractive.
Then there was e.l.f. Beauty’s campaign led by a comedian infamous for domestic violence jokes and disdain of a primarily female audience. And this year saw viral content around an OnlyFans star’s attempt to break the world record for most sexual partners in one day –– a lucrative career move made even more viral by her bashing the wives and girlfriends of her sexual partners and suggesting men cheating is the fault of the women who aren’t available enough for sex.
“Most typically, the male gaze is about representing women in media solely to satisfy heterosexual men,” said Dr. Linda Tuncay Zayer, professor of marketing and John F. Smith, Jr. Chair in Business Administration at the Quinlan School of Business at Loyola University Chicago.
If you are observing women in movies, TV, fashion, social media and marketing and they don’t feel as fully materialized as their male counterparts, that is the male gaze.
“The woman’s value is reduced in so far as existing for pleasure or basically an object,” Zayer said.
It’s Bond girls. And a long, lingering shot panning up a woman’s body in an advertisement for soda. It’s when an action movie accessory is running through explosions in tiny shorts and flowing curled hair before collapsing helplessly in the hero’s arms. And a social media star making a recipe while all dolled up and explaining her steps in a soft, sultry voice.
The male gaze has always been around — art in the eye of the male beholder — but the term came into modern existence as a feminist theory coined by film critic Laura Mulvey in 1975. Although it started as a lens through which to view film, Mulvey specifically calling out Marilyn Monroe’s appearance in “The River of No Return” and movie director Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rear Window,” it has expanded to encompass cultural perspectives that keep men’s stories, experiences and interest as the societal priority and treat women as objects rather than active participants.
The male gaze includes stories told about women in relation to a male character (think wife, daughter, victim) and media in which the camera angles and visual storytelling make the audience feel like they are viewing the women from a heterosexual male’s perspective, Zayer added.
It may even be hard to recognize when media is coming from the male gaze because it is so pervasive, Zayer said. “We’re kind of a goldfish in the water where this is part of our culture,” she added.
As you try to identify it, Zayer stresses the male gaze is not just about the way something looks — it’s about power. And media matters.
Characters in TV and film have encouraged women to move into science, technology, engineering and math careers, research has shown . When women around the world were surveyed in 2016 about how fictional characters inspired them, 16% said they wanted to pursue more education, 12% said they took up a sport, and about 11% said they left an abusive  relationship, said Madeline Di Nonno, CEO of the Geena Davis Institute.
“What happens in the world of make believe has real world impact,” she added.
The dominance of the male gaze hasn’t gone unchecked. Storytellers have been presenting alternative ways of viewing women for many years.
Often when women are shown as sexy or sexual on screen, it is a performance for men and doesn’t include their own search for pleasure or complex storylines. On the other hand, there is the female gaze, with shows and movies like “Bridgerton” and “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” demonstrating how women can be sexual without being objectified.
Mothers and daughters weren’t accessories to the men in their lives when Greta Gerwig joined the ranks of the few female Academy Award-nominated directors — for the 2017 film, “Lady Bird.” The film’s focus on the mother-daughter relationship helped audiences explore coming of age and the experience of womanhood.
Opinion: The female gaze is taking over page and screen, and it is hot
One of the most successful comedies of 2011 — and all time — is a film about an ensemble of women of different races, family structures and body types getting together in “Bridesmaids.” It’s hard to tell Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy that women aren’t funny— a trope that falls outside the narrow confines of the male gaze.
And beloved shows like the original “Star Trek” have appealed to audiences of all kinds while showing female characters and people of color in complex storylines and positions of power. NASA even gives credit to actor Nichelle Nichols (who played Lt. Nyota Uhura in the series that aired from 1966 to 1969) for working with the agency to help diversify its talent pool.
Some have called this kind of storytelling the female gaze. And while there have been powerful works of art and media with women at their center, they are still the exception and not the rule.
Take the Bechdel test , coined by cartoonist and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel in a comic strip. To pass it, a book, film or show must have at least two women; they must talk to each other, and about something other than a man. Failing the test is a good sign that media is part of the male gaze –– and you can probably think of plenty that can’t check any of those boxes.
Throughout history, when the pendulum swings one way, it tends to eventually swing back the other way. The same is true culturally. Although the male gaze has always been part of most cultures, there have been efforts to diversify perspectives, tell more stories and bring women into more positions of power.
Decades of fighting for women’s suffrage in the United States found success in 1920, which kicked off a decade of some relaxation of the restrictions on women. Instead of corseted dresses, women opted for looser-fitting “flapper” frocks with a boyish shape. But in the 1930s, trends changed again and women were in more feminine, cinched waists.
When World War II broke out in 1939 and women were brought into the workplace in the ’40s, fashion reacted with more functional, utilitarian wear. But when the war ended and women were forced out of the workplace, the full-skirted “1950s housewife” was the new (old) ideal of femininity.
“Historically speaking, there’s almost always a backlash after women have achieved something,” said Dr. Katherine Sredl, lecturer of marketing at Loyola University Chicago’s Quinlan School of Business.
More recently, women started going to college at higher rates than men, the gender pay gap started to close, women started having children later , LGTBQ rights made strides and body positivity pressed companies to diversify depictions of beautiful people .
But those trends were followed by the recent retro-popularity of “trad wives” and a resurgence of “thinspiration,” “skinny legends” and “what I eat in a day” videos that revived a restrictive beauty ideal on social media.
The male gaze remains a profitable marketing tool. Underlying many advertisements is the message that if only a woman could be more beautiful and appealing to men, they can find love, acceptance and a better version of their lives — all for the low, low price of these weight loss gummies or that workout program, these seductive undergarments or that new fragrance.
TV commercials for the fast-food chain Carl’s Jr. (or Hardee’s, depending on where you are from) used to feature models baring skin while taking a big bite. It started in the 1990s with men watching a woman eat a burger in another building through binoculars. In 2005, Paris Hilton’s ad showed her washing a car in a bikini. And celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Audrina Patridge and Kate Upton kept building on the commercial’s blueprint until about 2017.
That was when Carl’s Jr. changed to focus on using the food to market the restaurants. Many advertisers had stepped away from so obviously telling women they should buy a hamburger or other products to make themselves appealing to men.
Carl’s Jr. thinks its chicken sandwich is so hot, they put it on OnlyFans
The company GoDaddy launched its first commercial in 2005, when a model stood with the company name across the chest of her tank top before the strap breaks and she has to save herself from a wardrobe malfunction. The advertisements continued to feature beautiful, sexualized women — sometimes a bit of a confusing choice for a website and marketing services company — until 2013 when GoDaddy started to transition away from a strategy of scandalizing and toward a more inspirational and sophisticated approach.
But the changes haven’t always stuck. Social media influencer Alix Earle was featured in a 2025 Superbowl ad for Carl’s Jr., wearing a bikini top and taking a slow-motion burger bite.
There is an ideological gap between women and men — particularly younger men — when it comes to men wanting to adhere to more stereotypical gender roles, according to research from Ipsos .
This year, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that the corporate world has become “culturally neutered” and generally offices need more “masculine energy.” Meanwhile, both fringe influencers and more mainstream role models have taken to podcasts and social media to assert that women should be responsible for homemaking, and men for protecting and providing.
Kansas City Chiefs player Harrison Butker spoke at a college commencement in 2024 and told the women that they have been told lies about their futures and probably were more excited about being wives and mothers than taking on careers. And figurehead of the online “manosphere” Andrew Tate has preached male dominance and female submission to young boys.
However, those voices are being met with other perspectives: men advocating that sharing the mental load of running a household is part of being in a family or that protecting and providing includes supporting your wife and caring for the emotional well-being of those you love. Men can be strong, good listeners and be of service to their family, they say. Men who can take care of themselves (think laundry and cooking) aren’t just good adults — they may be more attractive to women, the counter-messages say.
And women often push back against narrow ideas of who they are and what they can be.
Women want to see media that resonates with their lived experience, according to research from the Geena Davis Institute , which studies representation in media. That can mean stories of women being powerful, flawed, beautiful, ugly, mothers and professionals.
Ultimately, women — who control a lot of spending power in society — often express loyalty to brands who give them that content, Zayer said.
“The business of it makes sense,” she said.
Although the concept of the male gaze originally came from film and has expanded to television, art and literature, it is deeply connected to finance, Joyrich said.
When the prevailing perspective in stories, art and advertising is White and male, then those who don’t align with those identities have less power, she said. And no one is immune from the societies and cultures in which they live.
Women sometimes turn the male gaze on one another. It happens when they objectify themselves, promote traditional gender roles as the ideal way of living and enforce beauty standards for others, Sredl said.
Sometimes women think it is empowering to utilize the male gaze, or to make a living in a society that profits financially off their exploitation, and others do it to feel in control, Joyrich added. “I might as well sell my own sexuality before you do,” she said.
But still, it’s large corporations that profit most, Joyrich said.
There may be ebbs and flows in how pervasive the male gaze is, but it has never really gone away, Joyrich said.
Women have made strides when it comes to representation in media — take Reese Witherspoon’s production company championing women-led stories and films, and “Selma” director Ava DuVernay’s critical and box office success.
But film and television has historically been dominated by male writers and directors. The efforts of female storytellers have largely been a push against the status quo. And often, the lens under which the works are viewed represent a dominantly male perspective.
If women want to be trad wives and men want to see a sexy sidekick in their action movies, why not let them?
The concern isn’t a woman baking in her finest pearls or wanting to be sexy — that is fine, and she should be allowed to do that, Zayer said. There are real-life implications, however, when spreading a message that women should only strive to please men and men should only see the women in their lives in one way.
Often the traditional beauty standards put forward by the male gaze are unrealistic. They favor thin bodies that few people can maintain in a healthy way, Zayer said. And usually, the standards prioritize Whiteness, Joyrich added. Women who don’t naturally meet those ideals are left struggling to win a competition stacked against them.
Both men and women should feel empowered to do what is right for themselves, whether that’s climb the corporate ladder or stay at home as a parent, Zayer said.
The male gaze also limits men when it encourages viewing women as objects rather than complex, multidimensional human beings, Zayer said.
In a world where male loneliness is a crisis,  the isolation problem gets even worse when the culture tells men that women (about half the population) are for beauty, sex and running a household, and are not viable options for real emotional connection and partnership.
If you want more full and rich stories about people of different genders, races, cultures and sexual orientations, you have to engage with artists of those identities, she said.
Fortunately, there is no shortage of fun, meaningful, interesting and high-quality movies and TV shows that offer a wide range of perspectives.
America Ferrera on the Barbie movie: ‘It really had something to say’
You can dive into the closeness of female relationships with movies like “Booksmart,” “Steel Magnolias” or Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” Or watch women be brilliant even when their sexuality isn’t in focus with “Hidden Figures,” Netflix’s “The Residence,” or “Lessons in Chemistry.”
Seeing women be the heroines of the action instead of — as Reese Witherspoon cited when talking about launching her production company — helplessly asking “What do we do?” is also important. For that, I can turn to “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “A Quiet Place,” and “Black Panther.”
Maybe your list is different, but I think it helps to be able to identify the media around you that expands the perspectives you are immersed in and the possibilities they present, and which ones, alternatively, make the box around identity feel a little smaller.
“By talking about it, by reading different things, by getting media literacy, by creating different things, by seeing the variety of media out there — including atypical, non-normative ones — people can start to think differently,” Joyrich said."

Al-Fashir is under siege by the RSF as it struggles to wrest control of the army’s last stronghold in the Darfur region .
The siege has spread hunger and disease in the city and relentless drone and artillery strikes have hit displacement shelters, mosques, and hospitals and clinics.
“Bodies remain under the rubble, and others were burned alive inside the shelter caravans, children, women, and elderly killed in cold blood,” the Al-Fashir Resistance Committees said in a statement earlier on Saturday. It said in a later statement that the shelter had been hit twice by drones and eight times by artillery shells.
The resistance committee said hundreds of civilians have been killed by the attacks, and residents who spoke to Reuters said they had dug bunkers into their homes and neighborhoods for protection.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/us/luigi-mangione-charges-dismissal-request,Luigi Mangione’s lawyers seek dismissal of federal charges in UnitedHealthcare CEO assassination,,,,CNN,"Lawyers for Luigi Mangione asked a New York federal judge Saturday to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count for which he could face the death penalty, from a federal indictment brought against him in the December assassination of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive .
In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers said prosecutors should also be prevented from using at trial his statements to law enforcement officers and his backpack where a gun and ammunition were found.
They said Mangione was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers, who arrested him after Brian Thompson was fatally shot as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference.
They added that officers did not obtain a warrant before searching Mangione’s backpack.
Why the terror-related murder charges against Luigi Mangione fell apart
Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson on December 4 as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company’s annual investor conference.
The killing set off a multi-state search after the suspected shooter slipped away from the scene and rode a bike to Central Park, before taking a taxi to a bus depot that offers service to several nearby states.
Five days later , a tip from a McDonald’s about 233 miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since then.
Last month, lawyers for Mangione asked that his federal charges be dismissed and the death penalty be taken off the table as a result of public comments by US Attorney General Pam Bondi. In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”
Judge says Justice Department officials may have violated order not to post opinions about prosecuting Luigi Mangione
Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other “crimes of violence.” It’s the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it’s not used in New York state.
The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime — stalking — is not a crime of violence.
The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.
After the killing, investigators found the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose,” written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/politics/fact-check-trump-17-trillion-investment,Fact check: Trump’s ‘$17 trillion’ investment figure is fiction,,,,CNN,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he has secured “$17 trillion” in investment this year – or even more than that.
“We have over $17 trillion being invested now in the United States,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. He added moments later, “We have more than $17 trillion in eight months.” On Friday, he said he thought the figure had “just cracked $18 trillion.”
But even the $17 trillion figure is fictional.
Trump’s own White House website values the “major investment announcements” this term at “$8.8 trillion,” around half the “$17 trillion” and “$18 trillion” numbers Trump used out loud this week. And an item-by-item CNN review of the top 10 items on the White House’s list shows that even the “$8.8 trillion” number is itself a big exaggeration.
The White House list doesn’t show that $8.8 trillion is “being invested now in the United States” or even that there have been $8.8 trillion in credible Trump-era commitments to make eventual investments in the US. Rather, the White House list includes:
The White House declined to comment on why the president keeps saying he has gotten “$17 trillion” in investment instead of the White House’s own “$8.8 trillion” figure, and it would not comment on the record to address CNN’s specific questions about the many holes in the “$8.8 trillion” figure.
Instead, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an email that the media is doing “pointless and pedantic nitpicking” and said, “The President is right: industry leaders have committed to investing trillions to make and hire in America, with trillions more to come.” He added that the media would be “beclowned” when Trump’s “policies take effect and investment commitments materialize into new factories and facilities.”
Here’s a fact check about what the top 10 countries or entities on the White House list have actually committed to – or, more to the point, what they have not.
The White House’s list of supposed investment announcements attributes $600 billion to “EU Firms.” But firms in the European Union haven’t invested $600 billion in the US during this Trump presidency – or even made promises to invest $600 billion in the US.
Rather, the EU has vaguely signaled that unidentified companies in the EU are interested in investing this much in the US during Trump’s second term. The EU agreed in August to the following language in a joint statement with the Trump administration: “European companies are expected to invest an additional $600 billion across strategic sectors in the United States through 2028.”
The $600 billion in “expected” private investment may never materialize. Justin Wolfers , a University of Michigan economics professor, noted in an August interview that “there is no commitment; ‘expected to’ is not a commitment.” Trump has wrongly described the $600 billion as a “gift” the EU “gave me” to “do anything I want,” but the money has not been handed to him to control, nor handed to anybody at this point.
“The European Commission cannot order or decide how private companies invest in the US,” Cecilia Malmström , a Peterson Institute for International Economics nonresident senior fellow who formerly served as European commissioner for trade, said in an email. “The figure given was an estimation of what companies have said they planned to do and invest in the coming years. It is not a legal commitment, and it would be a bit risky to include the figure in a budget or a forecast.”
The White House’s announcements list attributes $600 billion in supposed “foreign investment” to Saudi Arabia. But Saudi Arabia has publicly described the $600 billion not as “investment” but as an “intention” to engage in some unspecified combination of “ investments and trade ” over four years.
Experts say a $600 billion Saudi investment in the US over four years appears unlikely.
“The economic and financial relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia will deepen under the Trump presidency, but the numbers given for potential future Saudi trade and investment with the United States look too high,” Tim Callen , a former International Monetary Fund official who is now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute think tank, said in an email.
“If it is to occur during this presidency, the $150 billion per year average this implies is equivalent to 14% of Saudi Arabia’s annual gross domestic product, 40% of its annual export revenue, and just over 50% of its annual imports of goods and services,” Callen said. Referring to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, he added, “It is also equivalent to about two-thirds of the assets held by the Public Investment Fund, but the PIF has recently said that it aims to have 80% of its portfolio invested in Saudi Arabia.”
Maya Senussi, lead economist at advisory firm Oxford Economics, wrote in May that if global energy prices don’t increase, the Saudi commitment to making domestic investments “could restrict its ability to fulfil” pledges of overseas investment within the next four years. Callen also noted that Saudi Arabia did not come close to fulfilling what Trump has claimed was a Saudi pledge during his first term to buy $450 billion in American goods.
The White House’s announcements list includes $500 billion in supposed “foreign investment” from India. But India has not actually made any promise to invest $500 billion in the US.
Rather, an official joint statement from Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February confirmed that the $500 billion figure is a goal “aiming to more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.”
In other words, the goal would be met in part by Indian companies exporting more to Americans. And even if it was largely met by American companies exporting more to Indians, that would not be the same as India making an “investment” in the US.
The White House’s online list does say the “focus” of the $500 billion Indian “investment” is “mutual trade expansion.” Still, it’s inaccurate to describe the $500 billion figure as an Indian investment pledge at all.
“I would not include $500 billion on an investment chart,” Richard Rossow , the chair on India and emerging Asia economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said in an email. Rossow said “it is hard to imagine a jump to $500 billion” from the current level of Indian investment in the US. (A non-comprehensive 2023 survey from an Indian industry group found about $40 billion in cumulative investment in the US from the Indian companies that responded.)
The second-biggest item on the White House’s announcements list is $1.2 trillion in “foreign investment” from Qatar. But when the White House announced its deal with Qatar in May, it said , “President Donald J. Trump signed an agreement with Qatar to generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion.” The phrase “economic exchange” is vague enough to include two-way trade and US investment in Qatar rather than only Qatari investment in the US.
The chief executive of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund told Bloomberg in May that the fund planned to make $500 billion in additional US investments over the next decade. But Diego Lopez, managing director of Global SWF, which researches sovereign wealth funds, said that figure is “unrealistic” based on his organization’s estimates of the Qatari fund’s current investments ($524 billion in assets under management, with about $105 billion of that invested in the US).
Even if the fund did manage to invest $500 billion in the US, it’s unclear where the other $700 billion in Qatari investments needed to get to the “$1.2 trillion” figure would come from; Lopez said that “most of the sovereign wealth and firepower in Qatar” is held by the fund.
The biggest item on the White House’s announcements list is $1.4 trillion in “foreign investment” from the United Arab Emirates. While UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan did say in May that the country had a plan to invest $1.4 trillion in key sectors “over the next 10 years,” neither the UAE nor the Trump administration have explained how the UAE would invest that much in the US. The $1.4 trillion figure is well over double the UAE’s 2024 gross domestic product , and a document published by the White House in May notes the UAE had just $35 billion in total foreign direct investment in the US as of 2023.
That May document claimed that Trump “announced over $200 billion in commercial deals” during a visit to Abu Dhabi that month, but the list includes UAE product purchases and American companies’ investments in the UAE rather than only UAE investments in the US. Even if they were all investments, there would still be a massive leap needed to reach $1.4 trillion.
The White House’s announcements list credits Japan with $1 trillion in “foreign investment.” But the Japanese government hasn’t pledged nearly that much new investment. Rather, Japan’s prime minister at the time told Trump in February that Japanese companies would bring their level of investment in the US up to $1 trillion – from an existing level of more than $800 billion .
In July, Japan agreed to invest $550 billion in the US by the end of Trump’s term in early 2029 .
The money is supposed to be invested in specific key industries, including semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, pharmaceuticals, metals and minerals. A memorandum of understanding between the US and Japan says Japan has the right to decline to invest in an opportunity that was selected by Trump after a recommendation from a US investment committee, but if Japan doesn’t quickly provide the funding, Trump has the right to impose tariffs .
That’s a lot more detail than the statements from other countries and entities on the White House list, but there are still a bunch of key details left to be worked out.
Mireya Solis , director of the Center for Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution think tank, noted that Japan’s top trade negotiator has said Japan’s position is that just 1% to 2% of the $550 billion will be actual equity investment, with the rest in loans and loan guarantees. And Solis said “many Japanese companies are in a wait-and-see attitude,” wondering how the US-led investment initiative will operate.
Regardless, Solis said, the $1 trillion figure listed by the White House “seems extremely high to me,” adding, “I’m scratching my head, let me put it that way.”
The White House’s announcements list includes $450 billion in “foreign investment” from South Korea. But South Korea has actually pledged to invest $350 billion, in some form still to be determined, and negotiations over that smaller sum have run into difficulties.
The White House’s “$450 billion” figure appears to include a South Korean pledge to purchase $100 billion in US energy products during Trump’s tenure. But aside from the fact that product purchases are not investments, a South Korean official told The Chosun Daily newspaper that this commitment is not to buy an additional $100 billion in US energy products but to get to a total of $100 billion – so a total of roughly $25 billion a year, up incrementally from a 2024 figure the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis put at more than $19 billion . Other analysts use higher or lower 2024 figures, but they agree that the South Korean commitment is for an incremental increase.
In addition, the specifics of the $350 billion in supposed investment have not yet been hammered out . Following an August meeting between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, “the United States added a few demands that we found difficult to accept,” Foreign Minister Cho Hyun told the JoongAng Daily newspaper in early October.
Trump said in September that the $350 billion from South Korea would be “up front,” but a senior South Korean official responded on domestic television that this is “objectively and realistically not a level we are able to handle,” Reuters reported . The Korea Herald reported this week that South Korea is pushing to make heavy use of “loans and guarantees from state-run financial institutions” in the package, while the US “is pushing for a higher proportion of direct cash investment and wants control over project selection.”
Negotiations are ongoing, but they have been complicated by a strain in political and economic relations caused by a US immigration raid in September that ensnared hundreds of South Korean workers at a Georgia factory ​being built for two South Korean corporate titans, Hyundai and LG. Lee said in September that current US immigration policies affecting Korean workers will make his country’s companies “very hesitant to make direct investments in the United States.”
Victor Cha , Korea chair and president of the geopolitics and foreign policy department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a forthcoming article he provided to CNN that the promised $350 billion investment fund is “in trouble,” citing the immigration raid and financial sticking points.
“Koreans, already angered over the images of their countrymen in shackles in ICE detention facilities, may play hard ball and continue to withhold their massive investment commitments,” Cha wrote. He noted it’s also possible the two sides find creative “workarounds” in the negotiations, but it’s clear there is, at least, considerable uncertainty about the future of the promised $350 billion sum.
The White House list includes numerous investment pledges from corporations. The biggest is $600 billion from Apple . Tied for the second-biggest are $500 billion in artificial intelligence spending from Nvidia and a $500 billion joint artificial intelligence initiative from Softbank, OpenAI and Oracle.
There is an AI investment boom underway, and there is no telling how big it will be. But there is also a long history of splashy corporate investment announcements not coming to fruition, including during the first Trump administration . Expert observers have expressed caution about the pledges made this year – saying it’s likely the figures include normal spending and previously approved investments.
“Even the largest companies” like Apple and Nvidia “can’t realistically commit to an incremental spend of $500 billion over any reasonable timeframe,” Gil Luria , managing director and head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said in an email. “What they would most likely count in those numbers is their current spend in the US, as well as other spend they expect from their vendors, partners and customers. Even then, these numbers are more likely a statement of support for the administration more than a firm commitment of capital.”
Similarly, John Belton , portfolio manager at investment firm Gabelli, wrote in emailed commentary about Apple’s announcement: “The $600 billion will be spread out over several years and includes multiple areas of investment, from facilities to personnel to input costs, most of which was already reflected in Apple’s long-range financial planning.” Belton added: “For context, they unveiled a $ 430 billion five-year plan in 2021 , so a program of this magnitude is not out of the ordinary.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/sport/baseball-mlb-mariners-tigers-game-5-intl,Seattle Mariners reach ALCS for first time in 24 years after 15-inning classic,,,,CNN,"Four hours and 58 minutes after it had begun, the longest winner-takes-all playoff game in MLB history was decided in suitably dramatic fashion on Friday night.
With the bases loaded, one out and a full count, Jorge Polanco – who was 0-for-5 up until that point – sent the 472nd pitch of the night into right field, and sent the Seattle Mariners to their first American League Championship Series (ALCS) in 24 years with a 3-2 win over the Detroit Tigers.
“A lot of emotions since the start of the game,” Polanco reflected afterward. “I know we played a long game, but this team never gives up. I know there is a lot of emotion but we always try and keep it simple and just try and go out there and play.”
Polanco’s single may be the moment that fans will still be talking about in 20 years, but Seattle’s victory in Game 5 of the American League Division Series (ALDS) was defined by an extraordinary night from its pitching staff.
Starters Logan Gilbert and Luis Castillo both pitched in relief for the first time in their major league careers, while relievers Matt Brash and Eduard Bazardo made their longest ever appearances.
There were also contributions from Gabe Speier and Andrés Muñoz, after George Kirby had given up one run in five innings to kick things off.
“I don’t even know where to begin to try to recap all the heroic efforts that went into today. Just from one guy to the next,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson told reporters afterward. “Just an incredible ballgame from top to bottom.”
The home run of destiny: How a Seattle Mariners fan manifested Cal Raleigh’s moonshot
For the Tigers, another wonderful showing from Tarik Skubal would come to mean nothing. The two-time All-Star gave up one run off two hits and no walks in six innings, striking out 13 – a record number of punchouts for a postseason winner-takes-all game.
His dominance had Detroit 2-1 up after the sixth, in which Kerry Carpenter had hit a two-run homer off Speier.
But Skubal’s subsequent exit would see the Mariners tie the game immediately thanks to one of the evening’s many unlikely heroes.
Leo Rivas, a journeyman minor leaguer who only made his MLB debut last year, stepped up for the first postseason at-bat of his career on his 28th birthday. His single to left field brought home Polanco, and the game was tied again.
“It’s hard,” Rivas said afterward of a career which had seen him wait the best part of a decade for his opportunity. “(Watching) everybody go all the way like that. Most people just give up.
“It’s not easy. I was thinking to give up back then also.”
Rivas’ RBI single took the game to extra innings, where missed opportunities for Seattle in the 10th, 12th and 13th had the crowd at T-Mobile Park fearing a potential repeat of 2022, when the Mariners were eliminated at this stage by the Houston Astros after 18 innings.
J.P. Crawford went 1-for-7 that night, and so it was only fitting that it should be him who touched home off Polanco’s single on Friday to clinch the walk-off victory and begin the wild celebrations.
The Mariners begin their bid to reach a first ever World Series on Sunday, facing off against the Toronto Blue Jays in Canada."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/politics/free-speech-trump-first-amendment-analysis,Trump’s free speech backflip was 250 years in the making,,,,CNN,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .
“If we don’t have FREE SPEECH, then we just don’t have a FREE COUNTRY,” then-candidate Donald Trump said in a campaign video.
But less than nine months into his second term, he was explaining his administration’s stance this this way:
“We took the freedom of speech away,” he said at a White House event Wednesday as he tried to explain his call to put people who burn the American flag behind bars for years despite a very clear Supreme Court decision that lists flag burning as free speech.
Trump’s complete turnabout on speech is indicative of the contradictions and ironies in the bedrock principle of the American liberties in the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment.
While Trump came to office promising to restore free speech, particularly on college campuses and on social media, he’s now engaged in a multi-front war over what people can say in the US:
► A Ronald Reagan-appointed judge accused Trump’s administration of a “ full-throated assault on the First Amendment ” for targeting and deporting pro-Palestinian academics.
► Conservative Supreme Court justices were skeptical at oral arguments over a Colorado law that bans debunked LGBT conversion therapy , suggesting it may step on the free speech rights of therapists.
► Trump wants colleges and universities to clamp down on campus speech in exchange for federal funding.
► He applauded his FCC chairman, Brendan Carr , for trying to get Jimmy Kimmel’s show canceled by ABC, an effort that backfired.
► His lawsuits against media companies and law firms, none of which appear to stand on firm legal ground, have nonetheless been wildly successful in extracting settlement payments and sending a message to firms that would oppose him.
► Companies like YouTube have reinstated accounts or made plans to do so for members of his administration, such as FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who were suspended for spreading misinformation during the pandemic.
► His attorney general, Pam Bondi, promised to go after “ hate speech ” by people who she perceived as celebrating the death of Charlie Kirk.
The hate speech element is particularly concerning to experts because in recent decades, it has become a tenet of Supreme Court cases and free speech advocates that “hate speech” is such a nebulous term that leaving it unprotected would invite exactly the type of selective viewpoint-policing that the administration now stands accused of.
The hate speech in question was not any obviously repugnant White supremacist or racist ideology, but rather comments related to Kirk’s death, potentially including those who celebrated it. But we don’t really know since Bondi has not been specific.
US history is full of pendulum swings back and forth between freedom and restriction of speech.
The First Amendment, adopted shortly after the Constitution, guarantees Congress shall make no law “abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”
But within a few years, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which made it a crime to criticize the president, then John Adams, during the undeclared Quasi War between the US and France.
“The sad truth is, free speech has always been a weaponized slogan, right from the outset, when it’s first invented in the early 18th century,” according to Fara Dabhoiwala, a historian at Princeton University and author of the recent book “What is Free Speech? The History of a Dangerous Idea.”
Benjamin Franklin’s grandson Benjamin Franklin Bache was among those arrested for “libeling” Adams under the law. Federalists also threw a Vermont publisher and congressman, Matthew Lyon , in jail for criticizing Adams in print.
(Among other things, Lyon wrote that Adams had “an unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp,” and, separately, started a fight on the House floor over Adams’ foreign policy. Lyon, attacked with a cane after he spat tobacco juice at a fellow lawmaker, defended himself with fire tongs.)
Far from silencing Lyon, however, the Sedition Act backfired. Lyon ran a successful campaign for Congress from jail. The unpopularity of the clampdown on speech helped lead to Adams’ defeat in the election of 1800.
Another wartime restriction on speech, the Sedition Act of 1918, led to the conviction and sentencing to 10 years in prison of the socialist Eugene Debs for his criticism of the draft during World War I.
The Supreme Court upheld his conviction, but Debs ran a presidential campaign from his jail cell in 1920 and got nearly 1 million votes. President Warren G. Harding later commuted Debs’ sentence.
Courts and people have complex and nuanced views on free speech. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the unanimous majority opinion upholding Debs’ conviction, but he also wrote a key dissent in a case involving the conviction of Russian immigrants who distributed leaflets calling for a general strike in the US to interrupt the war effort.
In that 1919 dissent, he espoused what would become a more absolutist view of the benefits of free speech. “The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,” he wrote.
In the US, the evolution of speech has also turned on issues of race.
“If you go to the 1830s you would see that abolitionism was brutally suppressed in many Southern states,” according to Jacob Mchangama, executive director at the Future of Free Speech, a think tank at Vanderbilt University and a Senior Fellow with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.
“You would face jail if you spread abolitionist writings, so that was an attempt to try and contain abolitionists in the North from spreading their ideas to the South,” he told me in a phone interview.
Generations later, it was the civil rights movement that helped secure more and more protections for speech.
“The steady expansion of the First Amendment was to a very large extent accomplished by civil rights groups; you had the NAACP and Jewish organizations who were persuaded that adopting laws against group libel, as hate speech was often called, was detrimental to minorities,” Mchangama said.
Those protections have also helped protect the type of hateful speech that civil rights groups would abhor. Thurgood Marshall argued in favor of school desegregation at the Supreme Court as an NAACP lawyer in the Brown v. Board of Education case.
Later, as a Supreme Court justice, he ruled against an Ohio law in favor of KKK member Charles Brandenburg’s right to free speech.
It’s an important distinction between the US and much of the rest of the world, where laws are more likely to restrict speech. Mchangama points to people in European countries who have been jailed over Facebook posts, for instance.
Those cases are why Trump and Vice President JD Vance have both sought to lecture European countries about free speech — lectures that have not aged well as the Trump administration now tries to clamp down on dissent on college campuses and on television, among other places.
Dabhoiwala fears the US is entering a disturbing new period where speech is in danger.
Protections we enjoy today, he said, come out of the Red Scares of the late 1910s and the 1950s, “when government was trying to shut down socialist and communist speech and the speech of homosexuals and the speech of other kind of progressives.”
“And yet what we’re seeing is really a third Red Scare where once again, we have an authoritarian government trying to shut down political voices that it disagrees with,” Dabhoiwala said.
The larger issue may be what Dabhoiwala sees as a major flaw in the First Amendment, which protects speech from the government but is narrowly drawn.
“The government may not censor you, but any private corporation can sack people for putting a bumper sticker on their car or for posting something online, and that’s that,” he said.
To that point, Kimmel was put back on the air not because of a definitive government action, but because ABC’s parent company, Disney, made a business decision.
ABC needs its broadcast licenses, although fewer and fewer people watch TV over the air. Tech companies jealously guard their exemption from liability for what’s posted on their platforms, a relic of telecommunications law that was passed in the 1990s before the Internet was much of a thing. If you’ve heard the term “ section 230 ,” that’s what people are talking about.
“We’re in such a mess because these providers don’t have any legal responsibility to the truth or to the common good, and they are happily monetizing and making giant amounts of profit out of spreading lies and untruths alongside truth and deliberation of a serious kind,” Dabhoiwala said.
Mchangama agrees that untruths can spread quickly online, but he thinks the effects can be blown out of proportion and would be impossible to stop through content moderation.
“If you believe that everyone with an internet connection should be able to participate in the public sphere, then I think it’s impossible to try and combat mis- and disinformation through content moderation, because what constitutes mis- and disinformation is often very difficult to determine,” he said.
Dabhoiwala sees things differently. He wants more out of social media platforms because misinformation spreads quickly, but fact checking takes time.
“The moment we say this is all just the same and free speech, say what you like, you open the door to vast quantities of misinformation, to manipulation by hostile outside actors, by politicians just bullshitting their way to power,” he said.
Mchangama, on the other hand, hopes the American left will look at the Trump administration today and dial back on efforts to control speech.
“Power changes hands,” Mchangama said.
New leaders have new ideas about which groups are worthy of protection, and which should be targeted, which is what we’re seeing right now with Trump."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/business/rare-earth-minerals-trump-china-xi,"What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump’s threats against China?",,,,CNN,"The US trade war with China has a major sticking point: rare earth minerals.
China increased its restrictions on its rare earth exports Thursday , leading US President Donald Trump to threaten economic retaliation and imply he would cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during an upcoming visit to Asia.
The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China for years has built up near-total control of the minerals as part of its wider industrial policy .
China’s restrictions are also seen as a response to Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” on Chinese goods announced in April. After agreeing on a trade truce in Geneva, US officials had expected China to ease export restrictions on those minerals.
Here’s what you need to know about rare earths.
Rare earths include 17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.
The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are also environmentally damaging .
Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.
Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research note from CSIS.
Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls 92% of the global output in the processing stage.
There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.
“Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.
However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.
The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.
Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions come as Xi and Trump are scheduled to meet at the APEC summit in South Korea later this month.
In its most recent move, China added five rare-earth elements – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12. China will also require licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country.
It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that China violated a trade truce as Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.
The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a US Geological Survey report .
But it’s China’s latest restrictions that are seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.
“Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order’ that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday.
“For every Element that they have been able to monopolize, we have two,” he added.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/business/russia-ukraine-war-economic-levers-intl,Analysis: How to raise the cost of war for Russia - ‘Be cleverer’,,,,CNN,"Three and a half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with a US-led peace process on ice and a stalemate on the battlefield, Kyiv’s allies are calling for renewed economic pressure on Moscow. The aim: to raise the cost of war for the Kremlin to a level that forces it to change course.
Eighteen packages of European Union sanctions and dozens more from the United States, United Kingdom and others have weakened Russia’s economy – but not its resolve to carry on fighting.
What’s needed, then, is not just more but smarter penalties, experts say.
“We just need to be cleverer,” said Timothy Ash, a Russia researcher at the UK-based Chatham House think tank who has advised a number of governments on the impact of sanctions against Moscow.
A massive rise in military spending helped the Russian economy grow more than 4% in 2023 and 2024, but this year the government is expecting just 1% growth. It also sees inflation at 6-7% by the end of the year, and interest rates are at a painful 17% level, aimed at containing price rises.
The Kremlin’s hugely important earnings from oil and natural gas are falling and the budget deficit – the gap between government spending and revenue – is widening.
Yet the latest three-year budget plan, submitted to parliament in late September shows that military spending will stay at around four times pre-war levels. And that’s thanks largely to Russian taxpayers.
Starting from January, the Kremlin has decided to raise value-added tax (VAT) from 20% to 22%, with the extra revenues “primarily directed” toward defense and security, according to the finance ministry .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has openly acknowledged the economic cost of raising VAT, saying earlier this month that the measure would “be reflected in economic growth” – but he still defended it.
The Kremlin’s decision is “consistent with planning for a long conflict and a prolonged regime of constrained private demand,” Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN.
In other words, the Russian government has accepted the growing economic pain of the war. But are there potential penalties so damaging that they would sap Russia’s resolve to keep fighting?
The 500% tariff on any country buying Russia’s energy exports proposed in the Sanctioning Russia Act – introduced with bipartisan support in the US Congress but not yet brought to a vote – would certainly be one, argues Ash, an associate fellow in Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia program. “That would totally halt Russian exports. It would absolutely definitely crash the Russian economy and stop the Russian war machine,” he told CNN.
But no one, including Putin, who called the idea “impossible to imagine” last week, expects the US to go through with it, because taking Russian oil and natural gas off the market would raise global prices.
Instead, Ash suggests a much lower so-called “secondary” tariff , of 20-30%, which would allow Russian exports to continue flowing to the global market, but with a twist: The revenue generated should be used to fund Ukraine.
Using Russian wealth to fund Ukraine is at the heart of discussions in Europe right now about another economic measure – one that would also send a clear message on Kyiv’s longevity in this war.
According to a number of media reports based on an internal European Union document, the EU is considering using Russia’s frozen assets in Europe as the basis of a €140 billion ($162 billion) loan to Ukraine. Kyiv would be required to repay the debt only if Russia paid reparations for its war.
The new loan would send “a really strong signal to Russia,” according to Ash, “that Ukraine is well-financed (and) it will be able to buy the weapons to sustain a long war.”
In an opinion piece in the Financial Times backing the plan, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also wrote that “Moscow will only come to the table to discuss a ceasefire when it realizes Ukraine has greater staying power.”
Another option is to target new measures at the weakest points in Russia’s economy, suggests Alexander Kolyandr, a senior fellow with the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis.
His idea centers on Russia’s long-standing labor shortages, which have worsened since the war broke out and many working-age men have either been mobilized or fled overseas. Currently, Russian citizens face extra hurdles applying for work visas in some European countries, with the Baltics and Poland effectively banning them.
“Instead of limiting professional immigration from Russia to the West, I think a brain drain should be only encouraged,” said Kolyandr. Doing so would exacerbate Russia’s labor crisis, as well as put an upward pressure on wages, complicating its battle against inflation, he noted.
As well as taking a new approach to sanctions, enforcing existing sanctions more effectively is essential, experts say.
In a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine on the night of October 5, Russia, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, used more than 500 weapons systems containing over 100,000 foreign-made parts – including European ones. That’s despite Western sanctions banning the sale of billions of dollars’ worth of military and dual-use components to Russia.
“Now, in the fourth year of the full-scale war, it is simply strange to hear anyone claim they don’t know how to stop the flow of critical components,” Zelensky said .
Penalties for non-compliance need to be properly enforced, according to Ash. “There’s a huge windfall to these individuals, companies and countries helping Russia break sanctions,” he said, “but no penalties… no one goes to jail.”
But perhaps the most effective penalty on Russia’s war economy is in the hands not of Ukraine’s allies but Ukraine itself.
In recent months, Kyiv’s escalating long-range drone strikes on Russian oil refineries have, according to a recent estimate by Russia’s Siala analytics agency, knocked out 38% of Russian oil refining capacity – though Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, has said that such estimates do not account for how much was idle before and how much damage has been repaired.
Still, the strikes led to shortages of gasoline in Russia and caused it to export more crude oil, which is generally less profitable than selling refined products.
Ash believes the strikes are a potent weapon against Russia’s economy, for two reasons: “You’re not only causing domestic disruption to the economy through a shortage of fuel at the pumps, but you’re actually capping their export receipts as well.”
This strengthens the argument for supplying more Western long-range weapons to Ukraine and with fewer restrictions on their use, he told CNN.
And, based on Putin’s recent reaction, this is something Russia may fear more than any economic sanction.
At a Russian economic forum last Friday, Putin was asked what would happen if the US allowed the delivery of its intermediate range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Perhaps hoping to dissuade the Trump administration, he replied that it would lead to the “destruction of US-Russia relations.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/travel/travel-news-air-canada-free-alcohol,The only airline in North America to serve free alcohol in economy on all flights,,,,CNN,"Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter . Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.
In our weekend digest of travel and aviation news: air traffic control problems in the US, free economy-class alcohol in Canada, India’s much-delayed new mega airport, plus a European jetliner eclipses the Boeing 737 as the plane with the most deliveries ever.
The US federal government shutdown is now in its second week and travelers are feeling the impact as air traffic controller staffing shortages have led to delays at major airports including Chicago O’Hare, Hollywood Burbank and Newark.
The air traffic controllers’ union has urged members to keep working during the shutdown, despite not receiving pay, but a rise in employee absences has been the unsurprising outcome as the stalemate drags on.
In July this year, CNN visited the Oklahoma academy where controllers are trained . At that time, it was “the busiest” it had ever been following a massive hiring push. The work is high-stress and high-stakes , with a rigorous application and qualification process before candidates can step through the door.
Should your flight get delayed or canceled, whether through staffing shortages, a technical meltdown or extreme weather (a nor’easter is expected on the East Coast this weekend), CNN Travel has some advice on what to do next. Watch here .
Air Canada is offering free beer and wine to economy class passengers on all its flights — even short-haul domestic routes — making it the only North American legacy carrier to do so. This burst of bonhomie is not as altruistic as it might seem; it’s a sweetener following passenger pushback about additional fees for extra baggage and legroom, reports Reuters .
“Food and beverage just tend to have a disproportionate impact on customer satisfaction, more than any other attribute of our products and services,” said Scott O’Leary, Air Canada’s vice president of loyalty and product.
It’s not the first time Canadian hospitality has hit headlines recently. An ad promoting tourism in the land of moose and syrup went viral this summer for its compassion (and free hugs ).
While the air traffic controller shortage was the biggest story in North American aviation this week, the Trump administration also had some other plane-related worries on its mind, such as the 1937 disappearance of Amelia Earhart . FBI employees were ordered to immediately search for records related to the legendary pilot as a priority request.
The Airbus A320 family made history on Tuesday by overtaking the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered jetliner of all time, according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company.
The 737 held that title for decades, but this week the handing over of an A320neo to Saudi carrier Flynas brought the total delivery of the Airbus model to 12,260 planes since it entered service in 1988.
The European A320 and the American 737 are both single-aisle workhorses beloved by low-cost carriers and the world’s top choice when it comes to short-range air travel.
Asia celebrated an aviation milestone this week, too. India’s new Navi Mumbai International mega-airport has finally opened, having first been conceived in 1997.
Hills were flattened and rivers were diverted in the accomplishment of this engineering feat. Its arrival eases the burden on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International, previously the only airport serving Mumbai, one of the world’s most populous cities.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/us/palisades-fire-suspect-jonathan-rinderknecht,How the Palisades Fire investigation led to the arrest of arson suspect Jonathan Rinderknecht,,,,CNN,"Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, Jonathan Rinderknecht finished up a stint as an Uber driver and drove to a hiking area just north of Pacific Palisades, California.
It was a familiar place for the 29-year-old – not far from where he had previously lived, according to a federal investigator who provided the following account of his movements that night in court documents.
Rinderknecht got out of his car and hiked up the trail, past a sign stating “Danger” and “No Fires/Smoking,” toward a small clearing sometimes called the “Hidden Buddha” for a hollowed out stump where people placed Buddha figurines.
At 11:47 p.m., he took out his iPhone and captured a 360-degree video of the area. Seven minutes later he played the song “ Un Zder, Un Thé ” by the French rapper Josman, about despair and bitterness.
There, by himself, with the world stretched out below, Rinderknecht entered into the New Year.
At 12:12:01 a.m., a camera just under 5 miles away captured the first indication of a fire near that location, according to the court documents.
That blaze soon developed into the Lachman Fire, which grew to eight acres before firefighters were able to knock it down on New Year’s Day. But the fire continued smoldering underground, and on the windy morning of January 7, it started up again. That “holdover” fire rapidly grew into the Palisades Fire that swept through Pacific Palisades, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and killing 12 people, making it one of the most damaging wildfires in the region’s history.
What exactly happened at the top of that hill as 2024 turned to 2025 is now the subject of a federal arson case against Rinderknecht.
Investigators have determined the cause of the fire was an open flame, “likely a lighter,” to a combustible material like vegetation or paper, according to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint filed this week. The affidavit, signed by an ATF special agent who is a certified fire investigator, accuses Rinderknecht of “maliciously” setting the fire just after midnight.
At a news conference Wednesday, officials with the US Attorney’s Office and the ATF declined to speak to the suspect’s motive.
“I wish we could get into somebody’s head, but we can’t,” said Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper of the ATF’s Los Angeles Field Division. “People do evil things for whatever reason, and I’m not going to speculate or go into anything of that.”
Rinderknecht appeared in federal court in Orlando, where he is based, on Wednesday afternoon, and he did not enter a plea.
A judge denied him bail in a hearing Thursday on concerns he was a flight risk, according to CNN affiliate WFTV . Federal Assistant Public Defender Aziza Hawthorne said Rinderknecht was not a flight risk, adding “he is not a risk to anyone,” according to The Associated Press.
If convicted, he faces a minimum of five years and a maximum of 20 years in prison. CNN has reached out to Rinderknecht’s attorney for comment.
An examination of the 26-page affidavit reveals some of the gritty details of the eight-plus months of investigation that led to his arrest. There were high-tech methods: GPS data, fire-sensing cameras, DNA analysis and ChatGPT logs. There were decidedly low-tech methods: Closely watching his pulsing carotid artery during an interview, talking to hundreds of witnesses and meticulously sifting through the charred remains of the fire for clues.
“Part of the lengthy time that it took to go over the thousands of acres that were burned is we literally had agents with our partners on their hands and knees crawling through fire debris,” Cooper said at the news conference.
Here’s a closer look at Rinderknecht’s alleged actions on the night of the fire and the extensive efforts to investigate its cause that led to his arrest.
Months before the fire, Rinderknecht had sent curious prompts to ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence app, according to the affidavit.
In July, he asked ChatGPT to produce a “dystopian painting” with three distinct parts, the affidavit says.
“On the far left, there is a burning forest. Next to it, a crowd of people is running away from the fire,” he wrote. “In the middle, hundreds of thousands of people in poverty are trying to get past a gigantic gate with a big dollar sign on it. On the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people. They are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle.”
The app spat out this image, according to prosecutors:
Then in November, Rinderknecht wrote a prompt to ChatGPT saying he was 28 years old and mentioning a fiery event months prior, according to the affidavit.
“I literally burnt the Bible that I had. It felt amazing. I felt so liberated,” he wrote.
On New Year’s Eve, Rinderknecht appeared “agitated and angry,” two Uber passengers later told investigators. He dropped off a passenger at 11:34 p.m. and then went on up to the trailhead toward the Hidden Buddha area for the New Year, the affidavit says.
In an email, Uber said Rinderknecht passed his initial background check in 2023. The company said it worked closely with the ATF to help determine his whereabouts on and around the New Year and provided the ATF with GPS data and other information. Uber said it removed his access to the platform after learning of his suspected involvement in the fire.
Video footage and “Timing Advance” data from cell service providers showed he was the only person in the Hidden Buddha area that night, according to the affidavit.
The first indication of a fire came at 12:12:01 a.m. from the camera about 4.7 miles away that was set up to detect wildfires, the affidavit says. Another camera just .2 miles from the Hidden Buddha area detected the glow of a fire at 12:12:21 a.m., the document states.
At 12:12:31 a.m. and 12:12:50, Rinderknecht repeatedly tried to call 911, but the calls did not go through, according to cellphone data. GPS data of those calls shows him in and around the Hidden Buddha area, according to the affidavit.
After several more failed attempts, his 911 call finally connected at 12:17 a.m. and he reported the presence of a fire, the affidavit states.
During that call, he went to his ChatGPT app and asked a question: “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes,” according to the affidavit.
He made a screen-recording on his iPhone of several attempted 911 calls and his question to ChatGPT, the affidavit states. That action “indicates that Rinderknecht wanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire,” according to the affidavit.
Rinderknecht got into his car and drove away, but then turned around after he spotted fire engines headed toward the scene, the affidavit states. He allegedly walked back up the same trail from earlier and took iPhone videos of the Lachman Fire and firefighters.
By the next day, the fire appeared to those on scene to be extinguished. But it roared back to life less than a week later, leading to the Palisades Fire and its vast destruction throughout Pacific Palisades. The fire was finally contained on January 31.
On January 24 – while the Palisades Fire was still burning – investigators interviewed Rinderknecht about his alleged actions on New Year’s Eve.
In the interview, he made statements investigators determined were inconsistent with the GPS evidence about where he was when he first saw the fire and called 911, the affidavit states.
He said one correct thing – that the fire began on the hillside below and south of the Hidden Buddha area, according to the affidavit.
“The investigators are not aware of any other way for Rinderknecht to have known this non-public information other than having witnessed the start of the fire,” the affidavit states.
Further, the investigators noticed his carotid artery “would pulsate and become visible” when they asked how the fire started and who started it, a physical symptom supposedly indicating he was “extremely anxious” about that issue, according to the affidavit.
‘It’s tedious. It’s dirty. It’s not fun:’ Searching for answers in the wildfire wreckage
Still, determining how the Lachman Fire on New Year’s Eve actually began required painstaking analysis.
As the affidavit explains, investigators ruled out fireworks, lightning, power lines and sunlight refraction. They examined smoking as a possible cause based on Rinderknecht’s statement that he sometimes smoked, but determined the weather conditions were inconsistent with the theory.
Instead, they concluded the fire was incendiary and likely started from a lighter.
The affidavit gives several clues as to the identity of the specific lighter. On December 31, a video from Rinderknecht’s iPhone showed what appeared to be a green, barbecue-style lighter in his apartment, the affidavit states.
That same lighter was found in the glove compartment of his car on January 24. Rinderknecht’s DNA was found on the lighter, the affidavit says.
In cellphone video taken on January 1 at 1:44 a.m., over an hour after the fire began, the glove compartment of his car was open.
During his January 24 interview with investigators, Rinderknecht admitted he brought a lighter to the Hidden Buddha area, the affidavit states. He said he could not remember which kind.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/politics/stephen-miller-role-trump-crime-military-crackdown,Stephen Miller emerges as key architect of Trump’s offensive on Democratic cities,,,,CNN,"In the hours after a chaotic confrontation in Chicago last week that culminated with a federal agent shooting a local woman , top White House aide Stephen Miller delivered an urgent order to Department of Defense personnel: Prepare to send in the troops.
The facts on the ground at the time remained murky. Federal officials claimed local police were refusing to provide backup as they struggled to maintain control of the scene. The Chicago Police Department said otherwise, insisting officers were immediately sent to help out.
But inside a West Wing that had waffled for weeks over the momentous step of dispatching National Guard to the nation’s third-largest city, it offered a clear impetus, two sources familiar with the discussions said.
“Domestic terrorism and seditious insurrection,” Miller labeled the scene in a social media post, as administration officials hurried to draw up a deployment plan in a matter of hours.
The abrupt decision to send the National Guard into Chicago has ratcheted tensions between the White House and Democratic-led Illinois to new heights in the days since. It’s opened a volatile new front in President Donald Trump’s offensive in blue cities, while further testing the limits of his rapidly expanding authority.
And at the center of the controversial operation is Miller — the White House deputy chief of staff for policy who has accumulated such sprawling influence over the administration’s activities that he’s often referred to in Trump circles simply as “the prime minister.”
The 40-year-old immigration hardliner has spearheaded the federal government’s increasing encroachment into Democratic cities, marshaling federal law enforcement forces behind the scenes to carry out deportation raids and coordinate crackdowns that have put residents on edge and left local elected officials scrambling to respond.
Now, as the administration tries to expand its presence in Chicago and Portland over the objections of local leaders, Miller has taken on a far more public and pugilistic role — casting the effort as an existential showdown against American demonstrators and officials he’s branded as domestic terrorists for impeding his mass deportation campaign.
“The struggle that is taking place right now is between the lawful exercise of power by the American people through a duly elected government, versus the unlawful exercise of street violence in the form of domestic terrorism,” Miller told reporters earlier this week. “We see this playing out over and over and over.”
In a flurry of television appearances, interviews and social media posts, Miller has escalated his rhetoric to newly incendiary levels, attacking judicial orders blocking the Guard’s deployment as a “ legal insurrection ” and arguing that Trump should have largely unfettered power to direct troops where he wants within the country.
In an interview on CNN on Monday, Miller drew particular attention for referring to Trump’s “plenary authority” — a term that refers to unlimited power — before pausing when a technical glitch caused a different CNN channel’s audio to begin playing in his in-ear monitor. A senior White House official said that was meant to refer to powers reserved to the president, and ones that the judiciary could not “second guess.”
“The president has plenary authority to conduct his role as commander in chief, which includes, for example, the decision to call up the National Guard into federal service,” the official said.
Miller has portrayed protesters in Chicago and Portland as violent threats to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, suggesting the cities, with minimal evidence, are overrun with left-wing agitators engaged in a coordinated rebellion against the federal government. Miller has seized in particular on last week’s shooting in Chicago, which Homeland Security officials characterized as a “defensive” response to drivers ramming a Customs and Border Protection agent’s car. The woman who was shot, Marimar Martinez, has disputed the government’s account .
Judges are still weighing whether to block Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, in a legal battle that the senior White House official said was expected, but which the administration believes it will ultimately win in the appellate courts.
In the meantime, Miller has vowed to find other ways to circumvent any restrictions if needed — raising the prospect that the White House could invoke the Insurrection Act to grant Trump sweeping powers to federalize the National Guard and dispatch the military into American cities.
“They are actually, as we speak, trying to overthrow the core law enforcement function of the federal government,” Miller said in the interview with CNN. “It’s absurd, it’s unconstitutional and must be put down.”
The dark overtones have set Miller at odds with elected officials in those cities who accuse ICE and other federal agents of being the ones provoking confrontation, and with judges who have repeatedly determined that the situation on the ground bears little resemblance to the administration’s characterizations.
Even within Trump’s orbit, Miller’s forcefulness has surprised advisers who had long grown accustomed to his strident views, according to three people familiar with the dynamics, with some privately worrying that his militant language risks turning Americans against Trump on the crime and immigration issues where he’s traditionally held an advantage.
Yet allies say Miller’s harsh offensive is also a strategic one, rooted in a broader effort to catapult the administration’s portrayals of out-of-control crime into the public consciousness — and build support for a maximalist Trump agenda that relies heavily on exercising his executive authorities.
“There’s full comfort with him being on the air and driving the message,” said one of the people familiar with White House dynamics. “He’s not a matinee idol. But he’s a very effective messenger for what the president’s trying to do.”
In a sign of Trump’s approval, the president and other senior officials have adopted Miller’s heated rhetoric in recent days. After Miller on Monday characterized Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as providing “aid and comfort” to protesters he called domestic terrorists, Trump later called for Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to be jailed.
“I’ve seen the law, and when you have a group of people where the police call off the safety for ICE officials — I’ve understood that, and I’ve read it today in numerous journals — that that’s illegal,” Trump said on Wednesday. “And the governor knew.”
In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised Miller as “one of President Trump’s most trusted and longest serving aides for a reason — he delivers.”
The White House also noted that Miller’s vast purview as deputy chief of staff for policy as well as homeland security adviser naturally grants him a role in executing on all of Trump’s policy priorities, and that he regularly coordinates with a range of Cabinet secretaries including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
Still, within the administration, officials say Miller has emerged as a singular driving force behind a constellation of initiatives meant to assert greater federal power to shape large swaths of US policy and society.
The anti-immigration focus that drove his ascension in Trump’s first term has since widened well beyond the southern border to include mass deportation efforts across the country, due in large part to his secondary role as homeland security adviser.
The position grants him a seat on the White House Homeland Security Council, which has taken on far greater prominence than in past administrations.
From that perch, Miller has grown deeply involved in the sweeping range of anti-immigration and anti-crime initiatives underway across government. In addition to Chicago and Portland, the White House is in talks with Louisiana state officials about dispatching the Guard to New Orleans, the senior White House official said.
Those efforts come on top of an already wide-ranging portfolio that Miller manages as deputy chief of staff for policy, including coordinating several unprecedented investigations into universities and cultural institutions.
And in recent weeks, he’s taken up a fresh anti-crime push supercharged by the assassination of Charlie Kirk , a close Miller ally whose murder has spurred investigations Democratic donors and groups that officials claim are fueling left-wing violence.
“We’re deploying the full might of the federal law enforcement to crack down on antifa and other domestic terrorist organizations, led by Stephen Miller,” Bondi said during a White House event on Wednesday.
Miller’s reach has extended even into foreign policy as well, where multiple current and former officials described him as the leader, alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of a counter-drug mission that has carried out lethal strikes in the Caribbean on vessels the administration unilaterally deems to be trafficking drugs.
It was Miller, not Hegseth, who led the internal push earlier this year to use the military to target drug cartels , one source familiar with the process told CNN. Pentagon officials now routinely present Miller and Rubio with operational options and relevant data. They then decide what to do with it and work directly with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine to execute their military plans, said the source, who characterized the two men as far more involved than Hegseth in deciding how the military is used.
That deep involvement in the minutiae of initiatives across the government has prompted grumbling at times among a contingent of detractors uncomfortable with the immense power wielded by a single senior staffer — though few are willing to air their criticisms in public for fear of inviting his wrath.
“I don’t fault him for trying, but just because he tried doesn’t mean it’s legitimate,” retiring North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said of Miller’s persistent advocacy for norm-breaking initiatives like the National Guard deployments, even after courts have intervened.
Miller made some effort in recent years to build relationships on Capitol Hill with a selection of like-minded lawmakers. But he’s irritated other congressional Republicans with what two GOP Hill sources described as a go-it-alone attitude that’s prioritized the administration’s scorched-earth deportation tactics with little regard for the political fallout that members are then forced to manage.
One group of center-right Republicans, known as the Main Street Caucus, sat down with Miller over dinner in early September to press him for more details of his deportation strategy – and why he seemed to be diverging from the White House’s plan to go after violent criminals, one of those sources said. Those members received little in the way of clarity.
From immigration to DOGE, Stephen Miller is more powerful in the White House than ever
Yet even among Trumpworld critics who have wielded the “prime minister” moniker more as an insult than a compliment, there is grudging respect at Miller’s ability to steadily work his way into the small circle of Trump’s most-trusted advisers by — as he’s described it to others — remaining completely dedicated to implementing Trump’s vision, no matter where that goes.
Even when Miller is not in the room with Trump, the president will often hold off on making final decisions before soliciting his input, one of the people familiar with White House dynamics said. And while no one in Trump’s vicinity is ever regarded as untouchable, advisers and allies described Miller as perhaps the closest one to it.
The result is a growing mindmeld between Trump and Miller, they said, that has bent the administration’s agenda in increasingly hardline ways — and thrust Miller to the fore in its execution.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/tech/openai-sora-2-meta-ai-slop-social-media,The next era of social media is coming. And it’s messy so far,,,,CNN,"A baby running from a T-Rex with Lady Gaga playing in the background. Cats dancing on their hind legs dressed in streetwear. Bodycam footage of police arresting a pile of macaroni and cheese.
Big Tech wants to give social media an AI makeover – and so far, it’s a bit of a mess.
ChatGPT’s Sora app, where some of those scenes popped up last week, is just the latest entrant into the AI social media sphere. Meta’s AI app has a TikTok-like video feed called Vibes. You can chat with AI personas on Instagram in your direct messages. And TikTok’s AI Alive tool turns images into videos with just a simple command.
The moves are part of a high-stakes race that could shape the next era of the internet. Winning that race is critical for tech giants as they figure out how to make money from AI amid fears of a bubble .
Efforts to push AI into our social feeds have raised sweeping concerns across the web, from whether these tools violate copyright laws to how they might contribute to the rampant spread of fake content.
OpenAI and Meta directed CNN to the company’s safety policies and guardrails when asked for comment.
Within days of the Sora app’s debut, for example, Motion Picture Association CEO and chairman Charles Rivkin said in a statement that “videos that infringe our members’ films, shows, and characters have proliferated on OpenAI’s service and across social media” because of Sora.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post that the company will soon give rights holders “more granular control over generation of characters” and that it is exploring a revenue-sharing model. Prompts with copyrighted characters, like Pikachu or Spongebob, now result in an error message saying the content “may violate our guardrails concerning similarity to third-party content.”
AI has only amplified long-standing worries about misinformation on social media. But sophisticated tools like Sora, which can create lifelike-looking footage, have taken those fears to a new level, especially since it’s relatively easy to remove the watermarks indicating such videos are AI-generated, as tech publication 404 Media discovered and CNN has tested.
Sora-generated videos are also embedded with C2PA metadata – a behind-the-scenes industry standard signature denoting a video’s origin. The company also says its tech can detect people and public figures as part of its measures to prevent deepfakes. Meta says media created with its AI tools have an “invisible watermark” to help it track harmful AI-generated content as well as AI labels.
There are also growing concerns that AI chatbots are particularly harmful to teens following a string of lawsuits alleging that AI personas on the app Character.AI have contributed to suicide and mental health issues among young people. OpenAI says Sora includes “stronger protections for young users,” such as restrictions on generating mature content and restricting adults from initiating messages with teens. Meta uses technology to prevent adults who have shown suspicious behavior from viewing and interacting with teen content, the company said.
Then there’s the question of whether consumers want “AI slop” flooding their feeds in the first place. There’s nothing about the deluge of randomness on Sora and Meta AI that makes me want to endlessly scroll.
The very concept of combining social media with AI assistants caused confusion earlier this year. Some Meta AI users were seemingly unaware that their AI prompts – some of which are said to have included personal topics like medical or legal questions – were part of the app’s public feed. Meta said at the time that chats are private by default and aren’t shared to the Discover feed unless users share them through a multi-step process.
To be fair, endless scrolling isn’t the point of Sora and Meta AI. Those apps are designed to encourage users to create more videos using OpenAI and Meta’s respective tools, likely a bid to become the platform of choice for the next generation of influencers and internet stars as they increasingly adopt AI.
But the striking resemblance to TikTok and other short-form video apps sends the message that these platforms are indeed trying to be a destination for viewing content rather than just a forum for creators.
It’s perhaps a new form of social media entirely that even companies like OpenAI and Meta are still figuring out."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/asia/north-korea-military-parade-new-missiles-intl-hnk-ml,"As its ruling party turns 80, an emboldened Kim Jong Un shows off North Korea’s new hypersonic weapon, ICBM",,,,CNN,"North Korea showed off a new hypersonic glide vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) at a military parade late Friday, as it marked 80 years of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea.
The Hwasong-11Ma hypersonic weapon and the Hwasong-20 ICBM, which state media called North Korea’s “most powerful nuclear strategic weapons system,” were among an arsenal of North Korean weaponry featured in the overnight parade in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square.
The celebration came a month after leader Kim Jong Un scored a major diplomatic victory by traveling to Beijing for a massive Chinese military parade , where he had the rare chance to stand alongside global heavyweights on the global stage, namely Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Kim emerged from the visit with deeper strategic ties and a renewed friendship with China, North Korea’s longtime political and economic patron, as well as an increased vigor to pursue his missile and nuclear weapons program.
Since that meeting in Beijing, state media has featured reports of new or improved North Korean weapons systems – among them the Hwasong-11Ma, with a maneuverable hypersonic warhead, and the Hwasong-20.
The Hwasong-11Ma was first seen at a military exposition in Pyongyang a week ago.
The weapons of the Hwasong-11 series are short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) based on Russia’s Iskander missiles, which have seen extensive use in Moscow’s devastating strikes across Ukraine.
North Korea appears to have fitted the new 11Ma model with a warhead carried in a boost glide vehicle, essentially a flattened and finned glider that enables the warhead to take an erratic course to its target, making it difficult for defenders to spot and defensive missiles to hit.
It’s called hypersonic because it can make these maneuvers while traveling at more than five times the speed of sound.
The Kim regime has been testing hypersonic glide vehicles since at least September 2021. But a test in January 2024 used a solid-fueled booster rocket, as opposed to liquid-fueled ones in earlier tests.
Solid-fueled rockets can be moved more easily and fired more quickly – in a matter of minutes – than liquid-fueled versions, making them harder to defend against.
North Korea may have benefitted from lessons its ally Russia has learned using the air-launched version of the Iskander missile – the Kinzhal – in Ukraine.
But a number of analysts have been skeptical of Russian claims about the effectiveness of the Kinzhal, according to an August report from the US Congressional Research Service.
Earlier this year, North Korea announced that a new high-thrust rocket that would power the missile had passed final testing.
Meanwhile, the appearance of the nuclear-capable Hwasong-20 was the first for North Korea’s newest ICBM.
It’s possible that what was seen in the military parade was only a cannister believed to carry the weapon, atop an 11-axle transporter-launch vehicle, as Pyongyang has not yet announced flight tests.
That engine, which is solid-fueled and made of carbon fiber composite materials, has been tested nine times on the ground, according to North Korean state media.
KCNA said the engine would also be used on the Hwasong-19 ICBM, which has been flight-tested and which experts believe has the range to hit anywhere in the United States.
The ICBM appeared to be the last to rumble through Kim Il Sung Square on the the night.
“The spectators broke into the most enthusiastic cheers when the column of Hwasong-20 ICBMs, the most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system of the DPRK, entered the square, filling the track,” KCNA reported, using the initials for the country’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
While new missiles were what Western observers were eager to get a look at, the parade also featured upgraded main battle tanks, dubbed the Cheonma-20.
The tanks, with “tremendous striking capability and (a) reliable protection system, passed through the square with the will to annihilate the enemies,” state media reported.
Also in the parade formations were North Korean troops who fought against Ukraine, helping to expel Kyiv’s forces from the Kursk region of Russia earlier this year.
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the country’s National Security Council, was among foreign dignitaries at the Pyongyang parade."

“For us to be able to celebrate this, it’s truly special,” Wilson told ESPN on making history. “We worked our butts off to get to this point. And now its time to have some fun. I wish I could take this credit but this is God’s work. This ain’t got nothing to do with me. This is not about X’s and O’s. This is from what’s inside.”
Just like the story in Game 3 a few days ago, it wasn’t an easy road to victory for Las Vegas.
Despite a 16-point deficit going into halftime, the Mercury have proven in these Finals that no one can ever count them out.
Phoenix clawed their way back into the game in the third quarter, cutting the Aces lead to just 12 behind forward Kahleah Copper scoring 12 of her 30 points in the period.
Late in the third, it all came to a crashing halt as Mercury head coach Nate Tibbetts was ejected after being issued a double technical for arguing a foul call on guard Monique Akoa Makani.
The second-year coach appeared to be confused after the foul call before exiting the court and heading into the locker room tunnel.
The ejection grew the ire of Copper.
“I think the refs aren’t doing a good job tonight, I’m sorry,” Copper told ESPN during an in-game interview. “But we’ve just got to keep our heads.”
The Mercury kept up their resilience throughout the fourth quarter, turning it into a six-point game at one point but Las Vegas proved to be too much.
Copper would foul out of the game late in the fourth quarter just as the Aces appeared to have all but wrapped up the victory.
As the buzzer sounded and Aces players and coaches rushed onto the Mortgage Matchup Center floor to celebrate the win, guard Chelsea Gray commended her team for getting through the adversity they faced all season.
“This team has been through hell and back,” an emotional Gray told ESPN after the game before hugging head coach Becky Hammon. “What a run. Everyone stepped up. Everybody. We got the best player in the world in A’ja Wilson. … We’re champions bro.”
The start of the 2025 season was a grueling one for the Aces, starting out 14-14 before winning their last 16 regular season games.
As WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert was booed loudly while addressing the Phoenix crowd, it was Aces and NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis who got to hoist the WNBA championship trophy first.
The loss is a familiar feeling for Phoenix, who have now lost in the WNBA Finals for the second time in five years.
Tibbetts didn’t mince words about his ejection and the refereeing.
“To me, that’s embarrassing. I feel bad that I was tossed. Been around this game a long time. I think it’s one of the weakest double technicals ever,” Tibbetts told reporters after the game. “I didn’t even know I got the second one, to be completely honest. I don’t understand it.”
Tibbetts added he wasn’t trying to get himself ejected.
“We’re playing for our playoff lives. Most coaches when they get tossed, you’re doing it on purpose. That was not my intention at all,” he added. “There’s been issues with the officiating all year. I have to look at it. I feel like I didn’t deserve that.”
When asked about her comments to ESPN during the game, Copper stopped short of expanding on her feelings.
“It’s cool. It’s done. We don’t even got to talk about that. It’s cool. It’s done,” Copper said.
Phoenix has won three championships in their franchise history, the last coming in 2014. The team came into Friday’s win-or-go-home game shorthanded after forward Satou Sabally sustained a concussion late in Game 3 and suffered another blow when forward Alyssa Thomas appeared to injure her shoulder before halftime.
She returned in the second half, but it was apparent the injury bothered her the rest of the way.
Thomas told reporters her shoulder was “good” and said she was proud of the way her team responded all season.
“I think this team just showed what we’re about. It’s a game I don’t think I ever been a part of like that, but super proud of how we fought, continued to play through everything. It’s been a great season. No one expected us to even be here,” Thomas said.
“Of course it didn’t go the way that we want it to end, but we have a lot to build on.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/rare-earths-china-trump-threats,"Trump says he’ll impose new 100% tariff on China ‘over and above’ current rates, massively escalating trade war",,,,CNN,"President Donald Trump said Friday he would impose a 100% tariff on China “over and above any Tariff they are currently paying” effective November 1 – massively escalating his trade war amid a heated dispute over export controls on rare earths.
In a Truth Social post, Trump wrote that China had “taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them.”
“This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago,” he wrote. “It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.”
Trump said he would impose the new tariff November 1 “or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China.”
Earlier in the day, Trump had blasted Chinese leader Xi Jinping on social media over China’s ramped-up efforts to impose export controls on critical rare earths, threatening economic retaliation and saying he no longer sees any reason to meet with Xi during a scheduled visit to the region later this month. At the time, Trump also threatened economic penalties against China, warning, “Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order’ that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move.”
“For every Element that they have been able to monopolize, we have two,” he added.
Beijing ramped up sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports on Thursday, expanding the list of minerals under control and extending controls targeting their production technologies and their overseas use, including for military and semiconductor applications. The actions targeted an acute vulnerability for the US – one that has driven a significant Trump administration effort in recent months to identify, and rapidly scale up, mining and production capacity. And it immediately set off alarm bells inside the Trump administration, according to several administration officials.
The move came as Beijing has sought to boost its leverage in trade talks with the United States and ahead of an expected meeting between Xi and Trump on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea later this month. Some administration officials saw it as a clear effort by Xi to secure leverage ahead of his planned face-to-face meeting with Trump, while others pointed to US export control actions that may have triggered a Chinese response.
Trump initially suggested on Truth social the meeting was now in jeopardy. “I have not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so,” he wrote. “This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.”
But asked later if it was indeed canceled, Trump responded: “I haven’t canceled, but I don’t know that we’re going to have it. But I’m going to be there regardless, so I would assume we might have it.”
White House officials viewed China’s move this week as a dramatic escalation that could threaten the meeting even before Trump took to social media to publicly make the threat, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the matter. But there are also private frustrations at the White House after the US Commerce Department expanded the number of Chinese firms on an export controls backlist late last month that could have frustrated China, sources said.
China had invited Trump to visit Beijing while he was on his trip to Asia later this month but without any clear deliverables the Trump administration turned down the invitation, according to the senior administration official. They had agreed to work toward a meeting on the sidelines of the economic summit.
Trump on Friday also slammed China for choosing to announce the steps Thursday, suggesting doing so minimized his attempts to secure a peace deal between Israel and Hamas .
“The Chinese letters were especially inappropriate in that this was the Day that, after three thousand years of bedlam and fighting, there is PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” he wrote. “I wonder if that timing was coincidental?”
Trump’s comments underscore the clear anxiety tied to Xi’s hold over a market critical to the national security of the US and its Western allies.
Top Trump officials have convened technology and rare earth company executives in their push to accelerate development up and down the supply chain necessary for domestic production, officials said.
The message delivered – in meetings and rounds of phone calls throughout the summer – was centered on the urgent need to mollify the risks exposed by China’s actions in the spring.
The administration’s efforts included the announcement of a $400 million equity stake in MP Materials Corp, the only US rare earth producer, and a government-backed price floor to bolster its operations.
But US officials have acknowledged that the overall effort will still take time and, as a result, leave the country and its allies vulnerable to Xi’s strategic whims in the near term.
That reality has served as the basis for multiple rounds of US-China trade talks in recent months, and has been a central focus of Trump’s approach to Xi in the lead up to their planned meeting.
China’s dominance has long been a concern after the nation’s hammer-lock on the market was laid bare during a 2010 maritime dispute with Japan.
But Trump’s decision to threaten escalating trade war with the country, at the same time the US has actively sought to limit western technology critical to China’s national and economic security, sparked Xi’s most aggressive moves to leverage that market dominance to date.
“It was a real eye-opening moment for the entire world,” a senior US official told CNN of China’s actions in the spring. “A seismic-level geopolitical moment where everyone realized the scale of the vulnerability.”
Wall Street investors were taking Trump seriously in the wake of his initial threat of economic retaliation on Friday. Stocks sank after the president’s morning social media post . The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%. The broader S&P 500 dropped 2.71% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.56%.
Tariff anxiety was at its highest in the spring when tit-for-tat tariffs pushed taxes on Chinese imports up to a minimum of 145%. Stocks nearly entered a bear market in April, and fears only started to ease up later that month when the Trump administration exempted smartphones and electronics from Chinese tariffs – a significant concession that represented the first sign of a potential breakthrough in what was an effective embargo on all Chinese goods in the US. In May, both China and the United States significantly reduced tariffs, and the markets have since risen to new record highs.
Although Trump eventually raised tariffs on dozens of countries’ exports to the United States, tariffs on China had remained relatively low, keeping economic angst to a relative minimum.
That’s why stocks are sinking Friday: The market had largely been ignoring Trump’s tariffs, because China’s trade dispute had effectively been a sleeping giant. Negotiations were slow-going but had managed to keep higher tariffs at bay. Now that the giant may have been woken up, investors are getting “Liberation Day” fears all over again. And for a reason: Trade with China is crucial for the US economy, particularly ahead of the holiday season (that’s why Amazon and Target’s stocks are sinking) and as AI heats up (tech stocks are among the hardest hit Friday).
Tensions have been bubbling for many months: Both China and the US have recently tightened export controls on key exports, including rare-earths and AI chips. They’ve launched investigations into each country’s major companies and imposed high port fees in recent months. The US threatened to block student visas and also imposed export controls for software tools, aerospace equipment and the sale of ethane, a major petroleum byproduct for China.
A US official said those options – and more – are now back on the table in line with Trump’s social media warning posted Friday morning.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/us/hickman-county-explosion-tennessee,"Tennessee military explosive plant: 18 people dead or missing after massive blast, officials say",,,,CNN,"Eighteen people are dead or missing after a massive blast obliterated a building at a Tennessee explosives facility on Friday, authorities said — a “mass detonation” so significant that it rattled homes miles away.
The early-morning explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems, which manufactures military and demolition explosives, left charred debris and mangled vehicles across a vast area. The blast was felt as far as 15 miles away and scattered debris over half a square mile.
Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said there are fatalities but did not want to declare a death toll yet.
“I always wish for the best,” Davis said. “Is there a possibility that somebody might be injured somewhere, or somebody that we don’t know about? Yes.”
Officials previously said they were “missing 19 souls,” but later clarified one person who was initially believed to be at the plant was located at their home. Investigators are working to confirm who was at the facility Friday morning and notifying victims’ families, according to a joint release from Hickman and Humphreys County officials Friday night.
“Our hearts are with the families still waiting for word tonight. We are doing everything possible to bring them information and support,” the release said.
As of Friday evening, authorities were still working to contact some of the next-of-kin of employees who were believed to have been inside the building at the time of the explosion, a law enforcement source tells CNN.
As part of the ongoing effort to determine which company employees may have been among the victims, the source said authorities are now also conducting analysis of records from nearby cell phone towers. The sophisticated process involves comparing the cell phone numbers of employees with local cell phone tower registration records to help pinpoint the geographical location of a device at the time of the explosion.
Davis described the aftermath of the explosion as “the most devastating scene that I’ve seen in my career.”
“It’s hell,” Davis told reporters Friday evening. “It’s hell on us. It’s hell on everybody involved.”
Work at the explosion site will continue into the night, he said.
“We’re working for our people, and we want to take care of our families,” an emotional Davis said. “I understand that some families get mad. I understand that some people get upset … We’re doing the very best we can to take care of this.”
Davis said investigators from multiple agencies have been assisting with the response but have not yet determined what caused the explosion. The FBI will be assisting.
“Do I see a short-term explanation? No. Do I see us being here for many days? Yes, I do see that,” he said.
Davis noted people were undergoing a “gauntlet of emotions” as first responders continued to search the area. The tragedy hit close-knit communities.
“I can tell you right off the top of my head that there’s three families that’s involved in this that I’m very close to,” Davis said. “When you have small counties like this, we know each other, we communicate with each other, we love each other.”
The blast shook nearby homes and set off smaller explosions, local officials say.
The explosion, which happened around 7:45 a.m. local time, was a “devastating blast,” but responders were able to secure the scene by late morning, Davis said.
Three people with “minor injuries” from the explosion were treated at TriStar medical facilities in Dickson, Casey Stapp, the spokesperson for TriStar Health, said. Stapp said two people were released, and one person is still receiving treatment at an emergency room.
In a statement Friday evening, Accurate Energetic Systems called the blast at its facility a “tragic accident.”
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers, and community members affected by this incident,” the company said on Facebook. “We extend our gratitude to all first responders who continue to work tirelessly under difficult conditions.”
The company, which specializes in making military explosives, is located about an hour southwest of Nashville, Tennessee, on the Hickman and Humphreys County line, the Humphreys County Sheriff’s Office told CNN.
The company’s Facebook page says it manufactures “various high explosive compositions and specialty products for the U.S. DoD and U.S. Industrial markets.”
Last month, the US Department of Defense awarded Accurate Energetic Systems a contract for nearly $120 million “for the procurement of TNT.”
Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates said the facility has about 80 employees, but it’s unclear how many were in the building when the explosion happened. Bates said one building on the site was completely destroyed.
“It’s pretty devastating to see this,” Bates said.
“It’s going to be an investigation that’s probably going to go on for days,” the mayor said. “This facility, they do manufacture, not only military, but demolition explosives for road work and things like that.”
Numerous law enforcement resources from across Tennessee have been dispatched to assist in the investigation, including federal agents and the Tennessee Highway Patrol Special Operations Unit, a source familiar told CNN. More than 300 emergency personnel were at the scene Friday, officials said.
The Hickman County Sheriff’s Office, Humphreys County Sheriff’s Office and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation.
Recovery and investigative work will continue through the weekend and the ATF’s National Response Team is expected to arrive Saturday to process the scene, a release from officials said.
The relatively remote area is typically patrolled by smaller law enforcement departments, the person said, which has prompted other agencies to volunteer resources for support.
The Hickman County Sheriff’s Office is asking everyone to avoid the area as emergency responders do their work.
Tennessee state Sen. Kerry Roberts told CNN the facility sits on a 1,300-acre campus and is a beloved employer for many people in the community.
He said it’s common to see employees at community events and people wearing baseball caps with the company name on them.
“It is a well-loved company in the area,” Roberts said. “So this is going to have a devastating impact on quite a few families … it is heartbreaking.”
Residents who live near the facility say they felt the impact of the explosion.
“I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” Gentry Stover told The Associated Press by phone. “I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”
Cody Warren, who lives in Lobelville, about 21 miles away from the facility, said the sound from the explosion woke him up and he thought lightning struck his house.
The plant suffered another blast that killed a worker a decade ago, according to media reports, and federal data shows it had faced fines related to work safety practices.
In April 2014, one person was killed and four others injured during a blast at the plant, CNN affiliate WSMV reported . The explosion, in the back of a building that housed shotgun ammunition, caused extensive damage. At the time, authorities said several companies operated on the Accurate Energetic Systems property but the blast happened in an area operated by Rio Ammunition.
Years later, records from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration show Accurate Energetic Systems was fined $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations for standards involving the use of personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and employee training about safety hazards, among other citations.
The records show the company contested the violations and eventually came to a formal settlement. Additional details about the inspection and its conclusions weren’t immediately available, and it’s not clear whether the plant has faced any more recent health or safety inspections.
Over the last nine years, Accurate Energetic Systems filed annual injury reports with OSHA showing it had a total of 46 work-related injuries, but no work-related deaths going back to 2016, the earliest year with data available. In 2024, the most recent year data was available, the company reported five injuries and one other illness.
In 2021, a former employee sued and alleged they were improperly terminated after being blamed for a fire that broke out at the facility the previous year. The company disputed that claim and the suit was dropped after mediation.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/trump-nobel-peace-prize-winner-machado,Trump speaks with Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado after his administration denounced the decision to award it to her,,,,CNN,"US President Donald Trump spoke on Friday with Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado after his administration denounced the committee awarding her the honor.
Trump has made no secret of his desire to win the prize. A growing number of world leaders have also said he should win the award. Those calls increased as his Gaza peace plan gained momentum in recent days. However, the nomination window closes at the end of January for the year, according to the award’s website.
On Friday, the Nobel Committee announced the 2025 accolade would go to Machado for promoting democratic rights in Venezuela and “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”
Machado said in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais that she had spoken with the US president but declined to offer details about their conversation. The opposition leader, as she had in her post accepting the award, expressed gratitude to Trump.
In remarks Friday evening, Trump confirmed he spoke with Machado, adding that she was “very nice” in their call.
“The person who actually got the Nobel Prize called today, called me and said, ‘I’m accepting this in honor of you, because you really deserved it,’” the president said.
“A very nice thing to do. I didn’t, I didn’t say, ‘Then give it to me,’ though I think she might have. She was very nice,” Trump joked.
“I’ve been helping her along the way,” Trump added. “They need a lot of help in Venezuela, it’s a basic disaster. So, and you could also say it was given out for ’24 and I was running for office in ‘24.”
Shortly after the Nobel Prize announcement, the administration reacted negatively.
“The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace,” White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a post on social media.
Machado won the award after years of efforts to promote democracy and has described her life’s work as promoting “ballots over bullets.” She was driven into hiding in Venezuela amid a sharp crackdown on dissent by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Many in the Trump administration had previously praised Machado’s work. The administration has also repeatedly denounced Maduro and has deployed a substantial military presence to the region to combat “narcotrafficking” – a campaign that many see as an attempt to weaken and potentially drive the Venezuelan leader from power.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio was among a group of lawmakers, including now US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz, who nominated Machado for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2024.
“In our work as policymakers who strive for democracy and human rights in the  face of dictatorial regimes in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, we have rarely witnessed such courage, selflessness, and firm grasp of morality as we have in María Corina Machado,” they wrote in a letter in November 2024.
“It is our firm belief that María Corina Machado’s courageous and selfless leadership, and unyielding dedication to the pursuit of peace and democratic ideals, make her a most deserving candidate for this prestigious award,” the group of Florida lawmakers wrote.
In April, Rubio called her “the personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism,” someone who “has never backed down from her mission of fighting for a free, fair, and democratic Venezuela.”
Trump himself, before his inauguration in January, said she was a freedom fighter who “MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!”
Machado on Friday dedicated her Nobel Prize “to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”
However, there were no warm words from the president’s allies after her win and the perceived snubbing of Trump.
Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy for Venezuela, declared the “Nobel Prize died years ago.”
Benjamin Gedan, the Venezuelan director at the National Security Council under the Obama administration, said it appeared the Nobel Committee was sending a message to both the United States and the Venezuelan opposition in its choice to award Machado the prize.
“The White House has been sending signals that it might use military force to topple this regime, and that it has the support of Maria Corina to do so,” Gedan told CNN. “It seems to me that the Nobel Committee would prefer that both the United States and the Venezuelan opposition continue to fight peacefully for change.”
“I think the US reaction might reflect both things – frustration that Trump wasn’t chosen but also discomfort with this critique of US policy in the Caribbean,” he said.
Although Trump did not speak publicly about Machado’s win until early Friday evening, he had, however, thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin hours earlier.
“There have been cases where the committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to people who have done nothing for peace,” Putin said in remarks in Tajikistan Friday.
“Whether the current US president deserves the Nobel Prize or not, I don’t know. But he’s really doing a lot to resolve complex crises that last for years, even decades,” he said.
“Thank you to President Putin!” Trump wrote in on Truth social, following Friday’s announcement, which included a clip of the Russian President who has perpetuated an ongoing war against Ukraine and has defied Trump’s own efforts to bring that conflict to an end.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/health-trump-covid-vaccine-flu-shot-physical,Trump received Covid vaccine and flu shot during second physical of the year,,,,CNN,"President Donald Trump received a Covid vaccine and flu shot during his visit to Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday, his physician said in a memo released by the White House.
“In preparation for upcoming international travel, President Trump also received preventive health screenings and immunizations, including annual influenza and updated COVID-19 booster vaccinations,” the president’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, wrote.
The president’s own CDC has shifted away from a broad recommendation for Covid-19 immunization; people who want one must now consult with a health care provider, a process known as shared clinical decision-making. However, a prescription is not necessarily needed.
The president’s physician also noted, without providing evidence, that the president’s “cardiac age” is 14 years younger than his current age, 79.
“President Trump continues to demonstrate excellent overall health. His cardiac age-a validated measure of cardiovascular vitality via ECG-was found to be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age. He continues to maintain a demanding daily schedule without restriction,” Barbabella said.
The president’s visit to Walter Reed on Friday was unusual, having been his second visit to the complex this year. He received a physical in April, and the president’s doctor described that as his “annual” examination.
The president clarified to reporters that Friday’s trip was a “semi-annual” exam.
“What is most apparent is that the White House medical team is concerned about something which prompted more elaborate testing today, and the report is striking in its lack of candor and transparency,” said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, an interventional cardiologist and CNN medical analyst. “It also is devoid of any data.”
The report says Trump’s test results are “stable,” but Reiner said that’s different from saying they are normal. “I can say that someone’s blood pressure is stable. All that means is the blood pressure hasn’t changed.”
The AI-derived tool to calculate heart age “is not a clinically used tool,” Reiner said. “Maybe it’s an emerging tool. But what they don’t tell us are the things that he did have, which are clinical tools.”
“It is more meaningful right now to understand basic testing to try to understand the president’s cardiovascular health,” he said. “What is his ejection fraction? Does his heart contract normally? What is his blood pressure? What is his cholesterol? Is there any evidence of a heart attack? Does he have atrial fibrillation? Explain to us why he has these severe bruises on his hands, which typically are caused by blood thinners. Does he take a blood thinner? These are all, clinically, very meaningful questions, much more meaningful than some AI-derived heart age.”
Trump is one of the oldest presidents in US history and has faced scrutiny over regular bruising on his right hand that he’s appeared at times to cover up with heavy makeup. The White House physician has cited “frequent handshaking” and aspirin use as the cause.
The White House disclosed over the summer that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. The condition is common in older people and easily manageable, but had sparked speculation about his health after photos showed swelling in his legs.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/asia/philippines-earthquake-mindanao-intl-hnk,Death toll rises in Philippines after twin quake triggering 2 tsunami warnings,,,,CNN,"Two powerful offshore earthquakes struck off the southern Philippines on Friday, killing at least seven people, while towns near the epicenter suffered structural damage and authorities warned of strong aftershocks.
The first quake of magnitude 7.4, in waters off the town of Manay in the province of Davao Oriental, triggered a tsunami alert for coasts within 300 km (186 miles) of the epicenter, but the warnings for the Philippines and Indonesia were subsequently lifted.
A second earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the same area seven hours later, triggering a new tsunami warning, with the country’s seismology agency Phivolcs warning of possible waves that could be more than one meter (3.2 feet) higher than normal tides.
People living near coastal areas in the southern Philippines were “strongly advised to immediately evacuate” to higher ground, or move further inland, it said in an advisory.
Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol described the twin earthquakes as a “doublet,” two distinct earthquakes that occurred along a massive trench off the country’s eastern seaboard.
There were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges, one official in Manay said, although the full extent of the damage in the Philippines was not immediately clear.
At least seven people were killed, civil defense official Ednar Dayanghirang said in a briefing. The fatalities were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicenter.
The twin quakes were among the strongest in recent years to hit the Philippines, which sits on the Pacific “ Ring of Fire ” and experiences more than 800 quakes each year.
It came two weeks after the Philippines experienced its deadliest earthquake in more than a decade with 74 people killed on the central island of Cebu following an offshore quake of magnitude 6.9.
A video posted on social media and verified by Reuters showed people in the city of Davao calmly holding on to parked vehicles that rocked from side to side as the ground shook, as metal gates rattled nearby.
Richie Diuyen, a disaster official in Manay, said the quake lasted 30 to 40 seconds and damaged some homes and the facade of a church, while leaving cracked roads and unpassable bridges.
“We couldn’t stand earlier. I am 46 years old now, and this is the strongest earthquake I ever felt,” Diuyen said by phone.
Earlier, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said authorities were assessing the situation and search-and-rescue teams would fan out once it was safe.
“We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” he said in a statement.
Phivolcs warned of aftershocks and urged people in affected areas to stay away from the shoreline.
Verified footage from the southern Philippines showed workers filing out of buildings to gather in the streets, lamps swaying in shops, and offices with toppled cabinets and workers holding on to desks as structures and fittings around them creaked.
Video images from Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi showed fishing boats returning from sea and children playing on a beach from which water had receded.
Phivolcs revised down the magnitude to 7.4 from an initial figure of 7.6, and put the quake’s depth at 23 km (14 miles). The second quake was also downwardly revised to 6.8 from 6.9, with a depth of 37 km (23 miles).
The governor of Davao del Norte in the Philippines said people panicked when the earthquake struck.
“Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/zohran-mamdani-gaza-ceasefire-trump,Zohran Mamdani opens the door to praising Trump for Israel-Hamas deal,,,,CNN,"Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, said Friday he’d be willing to credit President Donald Trump with brokering a ceasefire in Gaza if the agreement is enforced and “delivers peace.”
Speaking to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source,” Mamdani said news of the ceasefire had left him hopeful.
“What this agreement can never do is erase what the last few years of tragedy have been for so many, whether it be Hamas’ horrific war crime of October 7, or the Israeli government’s genocide of Palestinians since,” Mamdani said. “What we are talking about is no agreement can bring back the rubble or make it whole.”
Mamdani, a fierce critic of both Israel and Trump , gave his most detailed public comments on the tentative deal since the president announced it earlier this week. Mamdani’s views on the Israel-Hamas war have been closely watched in New York and nationally as he vies to lead the city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel as well as large Arab and Muslim communities.
He has frequently referred to Israel’s offensive in Gaza as a “genocide,” an allegation Israel rejects. In his statement marking the second anniversary of the October 7 attacks, Mamdani denounced Hamas, Israel and the US, which he said was “complicit” in Israel’s war effort.
“If the genocide ends, then I think that’s something worthy to be praised, and if the hostages are returned. Those things together have to be done in tandem,” Mamdani told CNN on Friday.
The subject of Israel and its war in Gaza has been a constant flashpoint in the race for mayor. He has been shoring up support in recent months across the Jewish community and affirming his commitment to fighting antisemitism.
If elected mayor, Mamdani would make history as the city’s first Muslim to hold the office. Mamdani’s state assembly district is home to one of New York City’s largest Arab American enclaves. Palestinian restaurants, coffee shops and mosques line several streets in Astoria where Mamdani lives."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/government-shutdown-federal-worker-firings,Trump administration lays off thousands of federal workers during government shutdown,,,,CNN,"More than 4,000 federal employees received layoff notices Friday as part of the Trump administration’s broad effort to reshape the government while it remains shutdown, according to a court filing Friday.
The filing provides greater insight into an announcement from President Donald Trump’s budget chief earlier in the day that the administration had begun government-wide reductions in force that had been anticipated since federal funding lapsed on October 1.
“The RIFs have begun,” Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on X, without elaborating on how many federal workers had received RIF – or reduction in force – notices.
As of Friday evening, RIF notices had gone out to employees at the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security and Treasury, according to department spokespeople, union representatives and sources directly impacted.
Treasury and HHS saw the highest number of reductions, with more than 1,000 workers laid off at each department, according to the filing in a lawsuit brought by two federal employee unions seeking to stop the layoffs.
Also, the US Patent and Trademark Office, which is part of the Commerce Department, issued lapse-related RIF notices to employees last week, according to the filing. And the Environmental Protection Agency sent “intent to RIF” notices to 20 to 30 employees, though it hasn’t made a final decision on whether or when it would lay off those workers.
Other agencies are “actively considering” whether to conduct additional RIFs related to the shutdown, the filing said.
Trump said late Friday afternoon that he plans to fire “a lot” of federal workers in retaliation for the government shutdown, vowing to target those deemed to be aligned with the Democratic Party .
“We figure they started this thing, so they should be Democrat-oriented,” Trump said, placing blame for the shutdown on Democratic lawmakers.
Trump did not provide details on what qualified the affected workers as “Democrat-oriented.”
Congressional Republicans and the White House have in recent days raised the threat of mass job cuts as they’ve looked to maximize pressure on Democrats to supply the votes needed to break a logjam in the Senate and reopen the government. But more than a week into the government shutdown , both parties on Capitol Hill have remained entrenched in their positions on what is needed to strike a funding deal, even for a short time.
Will the federal government shutdown affect you? Tell us about it
Earlier Friday, an OMB spokesperson said that the layoffs would be “substantial,” adding: “We regret that the Democrats have shut down the government and forced workers to be put in this position.”
While the White House has repeatedly placed blame on congressional Democrats for not reopening the government, it is initiating layoffs during this shutdown by choice – administrations are not required to cut jobs when government funding lapses. The layoffs are separate from the furloughs that always occur when government funding runs out.
Democrats on Capitol Hill swiftly criticized the move.
“Once again: if President Trump & Russ Vought decide to do more mass firings, they are CHOOSING to inflict more pain on people. ‘Reductions in force’ are not a new power these bozos get in a shutdown,” Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, wrote on X. “We can’t be intimidated by these crooks.”
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also argued that “nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this. They don’t have to do it; they want to,” calling the layoffs “deliberate chaos.”
Several agencies told CNN that they had started conducting the reductions.
“HHS employees across multiple divisions have received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown,” an agency spokesperson told CNN. “All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again agenda.”
Initially, the Trump administration promised to swiftly roll out mass layoffs of federal workers with the start of the government’s lapse in funding, but – as CNN reported – the White House then appeared to shift strategy, holding off on doing so a bit longer as an increasing number of Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials acknowledged the potential political perils of the move. Friday’s announcement came on day 10 of the shutdown.
Some furloughed workers have questioned how they would know they’ve been laid off since they have limited access to work email during the shutdown.
Administration officials said employees impacted by the layoffs would also be notified by the US Postal Service, which remains operating during the government shutdown.
The White House said furloughed employees can use government-issued equipment for purposes related to a shutdown, which include “checking for any Reduction in Force (RIF) updates.”
Agencies’ RIF notices typically call for termination within 30 or 60 days.
The American Federation of Government Employees called the administration’s move “disgraceful.”
“In AFGE’s 93 years of existence under several presidential administrations – including during Trump’s first term – no president has ever decided to fire thousands of furloughed workers during a government shutdown,” Everett Kelley, the union’s national president, said in a statement.
AFGE, along with another union representing federal workers, filed a lawsuit in a California federal court seeking to stop the Trump administration from initiating the mass layoffs, calling them illegal.
The unions pressed District Court Judge Susan Illston on Friday to immediately halt the RIFs now that the administration had started carrying them out. The Friday filing from the government revealing the number of people affected followed unions’ request last week for a temporary restraining order to block the administration from carrying out its threat.
Shutdown starts to hit federal workers’ paychecks
“We will see you in court,” Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing the unions, posted on X in response to Vought’s post.
Illston has not ruled on the requests but earlier this week ordered OMB to provide the status of RIF notices that were planned or in progress by Friday evening.
Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, previously told CNN that the shutdown does not give the administration additional power to downsize the federal workforce. “There is no extra legal authority on their part to conduct RIFs on the basis of a shutdown,” he said Tuesday.
In a statement Friday, Stier criticized the Trump administration for using “civil servants as hostages in this ongoing breakdown of our public institutions.”
“These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,” he said.
The Trump administration has been planning for – and at some agencies, already conducting – widespread reductions in force since soon after the president took office. The layoffs were part of a multipronged effort to downsize the workforce that also included multiple incentive programs to convince employees to depart voluntarily.
More than 2 million people work for the federal government. As of September 23, more than 201,000 civil servants had already left federal service, according to the Partnership’s tracker .
Trump had campaigned on overhauling the federal government and its workforce, whom he viewed as interfering with his ability to carry out his priorities during his firm term.
In February, Trump signed an executive order telling department officials to begin preparations for sweeping layoffs . The OMB and Office of Personnel Management followed up with a memo instructing agencies to submit two-part plans to carry out the reorganization – including submitting lists of agency divisions and employees performing functions not mandated by law or regulation who are not considered essential employees during government shutdowns.
Federal employee unions sued, but in July, the Supreme Court allowed agencies to proceed with their RIF plans, putting on hold a lower court order that had temporarily blocked Trump from taking those steps without approval from Congress.
Some agencies, including HHS, have already laid off sizeable portions of their staff, while others walked back some of their plans. And still other departments found they had to rehire some workers in order to carry out necessary functions.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/lower-drug-prices-trump-announcement,Trump announces deal with AstraZeneca aimed at lowering drug prices,,,,CNN,"President Donald Trump announced on Friday a deal with drugmaker AstraZeneca in his latest effort to lower drug costs through so-called “Most Favored Nation” pricing.
The move comes after the president unveiled last week an agreement with Pfizer to reduce prices on many of its drugs, as Trump demanded in a July letter to pharmaceutical company CEOs.
The arrangement with AstraZeneca, one of Europe’s largest pharmaceutical companies, is similar to the Pfizer deal.
Both have promised to sell drugs to Medicaid and set prices of new medications at “Most Favored Nation” levels, the lowest price made available in peer countries.
Plus, they will participate in the new TrumpRx online platform, which is now live and will become operational in January. The website will direct visitors to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer channels, where their products will be available at a discount to those willing to pay cash and forgo using insurance.
AstraZeneca said in a press release about the deal that it will allow eligible patients with prescriptions for chronic diseases to purchase drugs directly at a discount of up to 80% off list prices, which is the cost before any rebates or other discounts.
Trump also pointed to AstraZeneca’s promise to spend $50 billion in expanding its manufacturing in the US, which it announced in July. The company on Thursday unveiled a $4.5 billion investment in Virginia to manufacture a range of medicines including cancer treatments.
And like Pfizer, AstraZeneca is getting a three-year reprieve on having certain tariffs levied on its pharmaceutical imports. Trump noted that the reason manufacturers are agreeing to deals is because of his tariff threats.
“For almost everybody that’s here, most of them are here because of tariffs,” Trump said in the Oval Office event.
Both companies said the details of their arrangements were confidential.
Friday’s announcement was first reported by CBS News on X and by MSNBC .
Several industry experts, however, have questioned whether Americans will feel much relief from the Pfizer agreement and whether the company is really making notable concessions. Some have similar views on the AstraZeneca announcement.
“Confidential agreements are not a good way to make public policy,” said Rachel Sachs, a law professor at Washington University, adding that it’s not clear what exactly the drugmakers have agreed to, who will enforce the provisions and who is likely to benefit.
The extent of the savings on AstraZeneca’s drugs also remains to be seen. Trump said AstraZeneca’s drugs offered through the direct-to-consumer TrumpRx platform would include those for asthma and diabetes. A White House fact sheet touted discounts of 96% to 654% for certain inhalers, the latter of which is mathematically impossible .
AstraZeneca, though, already makes its asthma inhalers, including Airsupra and Symbicort, available for $35 a month in the US for certain patients – a move it made under pressure from lawmakers such as independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who opened an investigation into asthma drug pricing in early 2024. The company also says it provides help affording drugs to patients without health insurance or who have insufficient coverage.
What’s more, if the White House is appeased by these deals, then it’s less likely they will take aggressive regulatory or administrative actions, said Spencer Perlman, director of health care policy research at Veda Partners, which advises institutional investors and corporations.
Pfizer and AstraZeneca won’t surrender anything of value with most of the measures, Perlman said. However, agreeing to introduce new drugs at Most Favored Nation pricing could be significant – though it’s hard to assess without more details, he said.
Medicaid already receives hefty discounts from drugmakers, though any additional price reductions could save states and the federal government some money. Enrollees already pay little to nothing for medications. The White House said the provision will result in hundreds of millions of dollars of savings.
Also, while Trump is pushing drug companies to offer their products directly to consumers who are willing to forgo insurance and pay cash, experts question how many patients can afford to do that. For instance, Novo Nordisk announced in August that US patients can now get a month’s supply of Ozempic , the blockbuster diabetes drug, for $499, for those who pay for medications on their own and don’t go through insurance.
Plus, the president has acknowledged that his actions may result in prices rising in other countries, while coming down in America — calling that “fair,” when unveiling the Pfizer deal.
The efforts come as Trump has been pressuring drugmakers for months to lower their prices for US patients. He has long fixated on the fact that Americans pay far more for medications than people in peer countries, particularly in Europe, largely because their governments often determine the cost. Prices are nearly three times as high in the US as they are in comparable countries, according to a Health and Human Services Department report released last year.
Trump tried unsuccessfully to institute “Most Favored Nation” pricing during his first term. He said Friday that one reason he ran for election again was that he wanted to equalize the prices the US pays compared to other developed countries.
The main pharmaceutical industry group praised the Trump administration for focusing on what it called “foreign countries free riding off American innovation,” but said “the administration needs to do more to address unfair practices abroad.”
“Other countries routinely undervalue medicines and limit their citizens’ access to the newest treatments,” Stephen Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. “Most Favored Nation policies that would import these same prices into the U.S. would result in less access to treatments and cures and reduced investment in manufacturing and R&D. It happened in Europe. We don’t want it to happen here.”
However, Ubl noted that “each company makes its own decision on how they set prices for medicines.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/us/david-farley-oregon-doctor-arrested,Former doctor David B. Farley now faces criminal charges after multiple patients from an Oregon suburb say he abused them,,,,CNN,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This story contains disturbing descriptions of sexual assault.
A former family doctor who has been accused of abuse by more than 160 of his patients surrendered to authorities Friday in Oregon, where he was arraigned on felony sexual abuse charges.
David B. Farley turned himself in at the Clackamas County Jail in the early hours of the morning. A county grand jury indicted Farley on nine counts of sexual abuse and two related counts, all felonies, involving three female patients over a span of 11 years. One of the patients was under 14.
Farley, 67, appeared for his arraignment Friday afternoon via closed-circuit TV and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The courtroom’s gallery was crowded, with some observers weeping quietly during the brief proceeding. A judge set a December 6 trial date.
The moment marks a dramatic turning point in what has been a years-long journey for the scores of women and girls who allege Farley sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment. Some of the survivors have been urging authorities for more than five years to bring him to justice.
“The relief that ran through my body…is indescribable,” a former patient of Farley’s told CNN, speaking anonymously out of caution over the ongoing legal proceedings. “Just to know that finally something is being done on the law enforcement side after so many failures from prior law enforcement agencies brings peace in my life.”
The doctor was first investigated in 2020, when former patients came forward to file complaints with the Oregon Medical Board and local police about his conduct.
Those complaints ranged from excessive breast and pelvic exams on underage patients to ungloved pelvic exams and Farley taking naked photographs of minors for what he claimed were educational purposes. Patients described sexual abuse as well as being subjected to medically unnecessary and painful procedures such as “hymenectomies” in which Farley would insist on breaking their hymens with his hand , telling at least one teenaged patient he was doing so to “make sex more pleasurable.”
Through his attorney, Farley has consistently declined to comment on the allegations against him.
CNN reported on these allegations against Farley last year, sitting down with several of his former patients who described abuse they said they’d experienced and their quest for accountability.
Many of the women found Farley through church. They were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in West Linn, Oregon — just south of Portland — and say he was seen as a leader in their tightknit Mormon community. The women say his status as a respected elder in the congregation conferred a level of trust that allowed him to take advantage of them.
“I had no idea,” one of Farley’s former patients, Nicole Snow, told CNN last year. “I thought this was normal.” Snow said the abuse led to health problems that later caused her to drop out of high school.
The Oregon Medical Board conducted an investigation and revoked Farley’s medical license in October 2020. Meanwhile, the West Linn Police Department began to conduct its own investigation, led by District Attorney John Wentworth, and in 2022 the case went before a grand jury. But after deliberations, the grand jury said it did not have enough evidence for a criminal indictment, and Farley was not charged.
Farley’s former patients allege Wentworth and his team fumbled the case, only allowing testimony from a small fraction of women who had filed police reports.  In a March 2024 op-ed for West Linn’s newspaper , Wentworth defended his handling of the case, noting that “all known patients with a colorable claim of abuse testified before the grand jury.” In an email to CNN last year, he blamed “a litany of issues outside our control” for prosecutors’ inability to convince the grand jury.
Many of Farley’s patients joined together in a 2020 civil suit against the former doctor. The lawsuit now includes more than 160 patients – some as young as five years old. The patients also continued to push the only available avenue for Farley to face criminal charges – lobbying for the state’s attorney general to reopen the criminal case.
In December 2024, after years of defending its handling of the case, the Clackamas District Attorney’s office issued a request that the Oregon attorney general take over the investigation. The attorney general’s office did not comment publicly on the matter, except to say that it was reviewing the case.
But the office had quietly been moving forward, conducting confidential sessions with a grand jury that heard witnesses and resulted last week in the indictment. The charges against Farley relate to alleged incidents that occurred between February 2009 and July 2020.
“When these survivors first came forward in 2022 … their claims were scrutinized and dismissed rather than properly investigated,” said attorney Tom D’Amore, who represents Farley’s former patients in their civil lawsuit. “Their commitment to accountability, even in the face of such disregard, is nothing short of heroic.”
“When I was assaulted, I thought I was alone, I thought I had misread things,” former patient Katie Medley, who detailed her abuse in an interview with CNN last year, said in a statement Friday. “My faith in our justice system was tried over the years. But my sister survivors and I have never stopped speaking out and now we have been vindicated.”
Farley has since moved to Nephi, Utah, where he lives with his wife. A longtime friend of his told CNN that as of last year, Farley was still an active member of his church community there.
A judge on Friday set bond for Farley at $500,000. Farley is permitted to leave the state if he posts bond, but signed an extradition waiver stating he won’t contest orders that he return to Oregon for court appearances and to stand trial."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-trump-new-york-mamdani,Letitia James sees a record fundraising surge and Democratic support after indictment,,,,CNN,"President Donald Trump saw another one of his opponents indicted — but he also gave New York Attorney General Letitia James her best single day of fundraising in a nearly 30-year political career.
A source familiar with James’s political operation told CNN she brought in $567,000 from over 24,000 donors in the 24 hours after she was indicted Thursday afternoon on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Most of the fundraising came in response to emails her political operation was sending out to capitalize on the news, though some donations came in on their own.
Her prepared video response to the indictment drew 4.3 million views on X in that same 24 hours.
Trump had long called for James to be indicted and her team had long prepared for it. In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, national and New York Democrats rushed to support her, led by Zohran Mamdani, whom James has been helping both on the New York City mayoral campaign and in gearing up for governing if he wins.
Shortly after learning of the federal indictment, Mamdani summoned what is sometimes described as the sisterhood of Black elected officials in New York City.
“We are standing in front of the same courthouse where Attorney General Tish James did her job, upholding the law and holding Donald Trump accountable,” Mamdani said at a Friday press conference in Lower Manhattan with some of those Black female officials. “This is a blatant miscarriage of justice; this is a shameless act of political retribution.”
A Queens native, Trump and his allies have repeatedly reshaped New York City politics, from moving to drop corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams to threatening to pull billions in funding from the nation’s largest city if Mamdani wins.
James and Trump have a long history, with the state attorney general winning a civil fraud case against Trump and a roughly $500 million penalty that was later struck down by an appeals court.
So do James and Andrew Cuomo, now running against Mamdani as an independent mayoral candidate with Trump’s implicit support. James led the investigation and release of a report into sexual misconduct allegations that ultimately resulted in Cuomo’s resignation as New York governor. Cuomo insisted when he left office that he felt he had “never crossed the line with anyone.”
Several Mamdani allies ripped into Cuomo for omitting any reference to James in a post on X Thursday night decrying partisanship in the justice system after the indictment was announced.
“Her name is Tish James,” said Adrienne Adams, the city council speaker who also ran in the Democratic primary. “She saw through you in the beginning and she saw through you in the end. At the end of both spectrums, Donald Trump is still pulling the strings on your vocal cords.”
Cuomo and his top aides, some of whom worked for him in the governor’s office and now on his mayoral campaign, still harbor deep resentment towards James. In recent months, Cuomo has described the investigation led by James’ office as “politically motivated.”
The state of New York has spent more than $20.5 million for the legal defense of Cuomo and several officials who worked in the executive chamber from three ex-employees who have sued them.
“Sir, my message to you is we need to meet this moment,” said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, addressing Cuomo. “That is simply not the energy that we need right now. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for our city and our country.”
Councilwoman Crystal Hudson, a Democrat who represents the same Brooklyn district James represented in the City Council when she was first elected to public office more than two decades ago, highlighted the exodus of Black women from the workforce since Trump’s election and suggested the indictment was racially motivated.
“You have men who quite literally cannot even address the fact that this woman, and specifically a Black woman, is being attacked and maligned the way that Trump is attacking her and maligning her, it speaks volumes,” Hudson told CNN.
Hours after Mamdani’s rally, Cuomo issued a new statement calling for universal condemnation of politicizing the justice system. The statement included a mention of James but said Cuomo too had been the victim of politically motivated investigations.
“The weaponization and politicization of the justice system is wrong no matter which side you are on — period,” Cuomo said in the statement. “I know firsthand as the White House weaponized the DOJ against me when I was governor of New York and three other democratic states during the height of COVID and it’s wrong that it appears to be happening with AG James and Former FBI Director Comey — it is part of why people have lost faith in the Justice system, the cornerstone of our democracy.”
Mamdani said he had spoken to James shortly after the indictment became public to reassure her of the support she had.
“She told me, ‘Don’t worry about me,’” Mamdani said. “That’s indicative of an attorney general who has spent all of her time worrying about the people of the state.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/us/air-traffic-control-staffing,Air traffic control staffing problems continue to cause delays as shutdown drags on,,,,CNN,"The Federal Aviation Administration reported 12 of their facilities were short-staffed on Friday, including some which have caused delays for travelers.
Phoenix Sky Harbor International airport will not have the normal number of staff in its control tower from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. ET. Delays there started earlier due to staffing shortages in the facility that operates the surrounding airspace.
Two separate parts of the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center, that manages flights over a large portion of the Southwest, is understaffed until 3 p.m. ET. Chicago Center will not have all of its controllers until 1 a.m. ET, Indianapolis Center will be short staffed from midnight to 6 a.m. ET, and New York Center will be understaffed until 11 p.m. ET.
The Central Florida TRACON, where controllers guide planes approaching or departing Orlando International Airport, will be short-staffed from 7 p.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET. Two parts of the Southern California TRACON reported staffing issues until midnight ET and the Chicago TRACON is short-staffed until 1 a.m. ET.
Two different FAA operations that deal with traffic at Newark Liberty International Airport reported staffing problems earlier Friday. The control tower and the facility that handles flights approaching or departing the airport did not have their normal amount of workers, which led to delays.
Not all staffing problems cause delays, as controllers can sometimes route planes to other airspace with more workers, but there are times slowing flights so a reduced number of staff can manage them is the only way to make everyone is safe.
The reasons for the short staffing are not clear, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work.
Air traffic controllers, along with Transportation Security Administration officers, are considered essential employees and have to work during the shutdown, despite not being currently paid.
Twelve FAA facilities saw staffing shortages Thursday , including airport towers, approach controls which handle arriving and departing flights as well as centers that handle flights en route.
This busy holiday weekend travelers are being warned they could see delays and cancellations from the government shutdown at the airports.
“It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,” Airlines for America, the industry trade group, said in a statement.
Thursday was the 12th busiest day so far in 2025, according to the Transportation Security Administration and the rest of the weekend is expected to be busy as well.
“The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience,” Airlines for America added.
The “safety and efficiency” of air travel in the United States depends on unpaid air traffic controllers showing up to work, the FAA administrator said in a memo to employees on Friday morning.
“To the entire FAA team, both those continuing operations and those currently furloughed, thank you for your professionalism and resilience,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in the email. “Your efforts to keep thousands of flights operating safely each day are noticed and deeply appreciated.”
On Thursday Duffy noted more than half of air traffic delays are now being caused by staffing shortages, as opposed to only 5% earlier this year.
“As Secretary Duffy has said, staffing shortages have increased across the country. Air traffic controllers are still required to report to work and carry out their critical duties. The safety and efficiency of our airspace depend on them,” Bedford said in the memo.
He also vowed to delay flights whenever necessary to make sure they are safe.
“I also want to be very clear that safety will never be compromised. When staffing constraints occur, we will reduce the flow of air traffic into affected airports and centers to maintain safe operations,” Bedford said. “We will get through this together and continue delivering for the American people.”
On Tuesday, air traffic controllers will receive a partial paycheck for hours worked before the shutdown. They will not be paid for the time they are working now until the government reopens.
Duffy said on Thursday he will not allow air traffic controllers to use their position as a “bludgeon” for political purposes, including calling out sick during the government shutdown.
There has been a shortage of air traffic controllers for years, so even a small number of unscheduled absences can lead to delayed flights
“When we have small sick outs, if you will, it has massive impacts on the airspace,” the secretary said in an interview with CNN partner Scripps News. “We can’t be held hostage, anywhere in government or in our lives, with people who are going to use their positions as a bludgeon.”
Duffy noted most controllers are “great people” but he reiterated his commitment to fire the “small few” who chose not to come to work to protest the shutdown.
“If they’re sick, they’re sick. I’m fine with that. But if they’re not showing up to work, and they’re calling out for other reasons, and it’s coordinated and they collaborate on it, I don’t want those people working in air traffic,” he said. “I’m not going to have them leverage our system, our air travel system, for political benefit. I don’t like it, and so I’m willing to make changes that are necessary so that doesn’t happen again in the future.”
Local leaders of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) spoke about the importance of air traffic controllers continuing to show up to work in a video message published on the 10th day of the federal government shutdown.
“Even though some aspects of the government may shut down, we never do,” Vanesa Hess, facility vice president at Denver Center, said in the video.
Patrick James, a facility president at Kansas City Center, said it was “vitally important” for air traffic controllers to “continue to show up to work and maintain the safe skies the American people deserve.”
“I urge you – if you’re fit for duty, continue to serve the American flying public,” Alex Cisneros, facility president at Southern California TRACON, said in the video message.
In a separate video released Friday, the head of NATCA urged elected officials to end the federal shutdown and pushed back on the “persistent false narrative that air traffic controllers somehow control its outcome.”
“Let me be clear: air traffic controllers did not start this shutdown, and we will not be responsible for ending it,” NATCA president Nick Daniels said in a video statement Friday.
NATCA represents nearly 11,000 certified Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers and more than 3,300 trainees, according to the organization.
Daniels said the system has been facing challenges for years, adding that hundreds of ATC Zero events – where a control facility shuts down – earlier this year received little media attention. The control tower at Burbank Hollywood Airport went ATC Zero earlier this week when there were not enough staff to operate it.
“The difference now is the extreme attention being paid to these things and the unfair assignment of blame on the aviation professionals that continue to keep this nation’s airspace running during a government shutdown,” he said.
Daniels said his organization will continue to work alongside the Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford to address some of the problems facing the air traffic control system, including by increasing hiring and modernizing equipment.
“The current shutdown is an unfortunate obstacle to achieving these important shared goals, and at this moment of historic aviation challenges, NATCA’s leaders and its members remain steadfast,” the president said.
He thanked air traffic controllers for their “unwavering professionalism.”
“You are highly trained, highly skilled, and uniquely positioned to make sure that the system remains the safest and most efficient in the world,” Daniels said. “You remain the unsung heroes of the aviation system even as you work without a paycheck with no clear end in sight.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/asia/japan-takaichi-ldp-leader-hnk-intl-dst,Sanae Takaichi: The heavy metal fan aspiring to be Japan’s first female PM has many reasons to be stressed,,,,CNN,"For most of her life, Sanae Takaichi has loved heavy metal.
Since drumming in a college band, the 64-year-old politician has remained a fan of groups like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. She used to play so hard that she carried four pairs of sticks as back-up in case they snapped, Japanese media has reported.
But unlike most metalheads who mellow with age, the woman likely to be Japan’s next prime minister is still an enthusiast. She has an electric drum set at home and bangs out songs whenever she’s stressed, usually about her husband.
“I play after he goes to sleep,” she joked during a recent interview with a Japanese YouTuber.
That same headbanging energy has defined her steady, albeit unconventional, political rise.
The staunch conservative and longtime lawmaker won Japan’s ruling party’s presidency on October 4 , becoming the first woman ever to secure the post, after her third attempt. But with her coalition prospects in doubt, and the party weakened by scandal and voter frustration, her route to Japan’s top job is far from assured.
Days after winning the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership, a victory that would normally all but guarantee the premiership, Takaichi was dealt an unexpected setback. The LDP’s longtime coalition partner, Komeito, announced it would not join a government under her, citing lingering mistrust over an LDP political slush fund scandal. The split leaves Takaichi scrambling to secure enough parliamentary support to form a stable administration.
And even if she does become Japan’s first woman prime minister, she will inherit a daunting list of challenges.
Takaichi has long championed conservative policies, rooted in nationalist and traditionalist ideals. Her win, a surprising triumph in Japan’s deeply patriarchal political system, signals to disillusioned LDP voters that traditional conservatism is alive and well.
A prominent member of the ultranationalist lobby group Nippon Kaigi, she promotes a patriotic education. She’s also supported revising Japan’s pacifist constitution, particularly Article 9, which renounces war and bans military forces.
Unlike many of her male peers, Takaichi doesn’t come from a political dynasty. She was born in Nara prefecture to a father who worked for a car company and a mother who was a police officer.
Before entering politics, she interned for a US Democratic congresswoman and worked as a TV commentator, “wearing miniskirts, riding motorcycles and presenting herself in a lively, unconventional way that sharply contrasted with the typical older male commentators,” Hajime Kidera, a professor at Meiji University’s School of Political Science and Economics, told CNN.
But Takaichi gave up her beloved Kawasaki Z400GP motorcycle after becoming a lawmaker in 1993 at age 32, reportedly to avoid accidents that could hinder her work.
Her first stint in politics was as an independent lawmaker in Japan’s parliament. Around that time, she met the hairdresser who’d style her hair for the next three decades. From the start, Yukitoshi Arai told CNN, Takaichi aspired to be like Margaret Thatcher.
When Arai learned Takaichi had won the LDP leadership, he said, “I was so happy it gave me goosebumps.”
He fondly recalled how, after early political struggles, Takaichi joined the LDP in 1996. “We decided to express her renewed determination with her hair and cut it short,” he said. Thus was born the iconic “Sanae cut” – sleek, sharp and practical for a busy politician.
Since joining the LDP, Takaichi has been re-elected nine times. She’s held multiple cabinet posts, including on gender equality and demographic issues, and chaired the party’s Policy Research Council. Most recently, she served as minister of economic security under the administration of Fumio Kishida.
Takaichi married in 2004. In a recent interview, she said she agreed to marry her husband, a fellow LDP lawmaker, without ever going on a date.
He proposed over the phone, saying he’d had his eyes on her “for some time.” His audacity and her rashness might surprise some. But her husband was a catch, she said – he’s a trained chef.
“He told me, ‘You’ll never go a day without eating good food.’ So, I just took the plunge,” she laughed, admitting she’s not much of a cook herself.
Japan’s economic and demographic woes pose immediate challenges for Takaichi, should she become Japan’s next prime minister.
The country’s declining birthrate means a shrinking workforce saddled with supporting a swelling elderly population. Record high inflation and a weak yen are also squeezing households and driving up living costs.
Soon after her election, the yen hit a new low amid expectations of major fiscal stimulus. Takaichi has floated large-scale spending and low inflation under her own banner, “Sanaenomics,” echoing her mentor Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics.”
“That kind of talk can weaken the yen further and raise concerns about Japan’s debt levels. For ordinary people already struggling with rising prices, it’s also a serious worry,” Kidera, the politics professor from Meiji University, said.
Trump announces US-Japan trade deal
Trade relations with Washington could prove tricky, particularly over a $550 billion Japan-to-US investment deal announced in September, which Takaichi has previously said she could revisit.
As it stands, Japan’s investment in the US targets sectors like semiconductors, energy, pharmaceuticals and shipbuilding, while also purchasing $8 billion annually in US agricultural products. In return, the US has reduced tariffs on Japanese goods, including cars, to a baseline of 15%.
With few details about the $550 billion investment deal available, and given President Donald Trump’s mercurial nature, Takaichi appears to be waiting to see how it unfolds, said Rintaro Nishimura, a Tokyo-based senior associate at The Asia Group, a consulting firm.
Her first test with Washington could come quickly. If Takaichi can form a coalition and Trump’s schedule allows time around the ASEAN summit, they could meet at the end of October – potentially just days into her premiership.
But despite her short runway, comparisons between the two conservative leaders are already being drawn. As a protégé of Abe, who enjoyed a close rapport with Trump, Takaichi is expected to follow her mentor’s diplomatic playbook. Like Abe, Takaichi has called for sharp increases in Japan’s defense budget, a move likely to be welcomed by the Trump administration, which has urged Tokyo to approach NATO’s 5% benchmark.
Geopolitics will further test her leadership. Known as a China hawk, Takaichi has previously suggested that Chinese residents in Japan have a “duty to aid Chinese espionage.” She’s also argued that Japanese war crimes have been exaggerated, and makes regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where Japan’s war dead, including convicted war criminals, are enshrined. Several of her cabinet picks have close ties to Taiwan, risking friction with Beijing, Japan’s top trading partner.
Yet analysts expect her stance on visits to the Yasukuni shrine will soften in office. “In reality, Takaichi will likely follow a logic of practical diplomacy. She’ll have to tone down the anti-China rhetoric she’s shown in the past,” political analyst Nishimura told CNN.
Signs of moderation have already appeared. Takaichi said she won’t visit Yasukuni during its autumn festival, likely to reassure uneasy coalition partners.
Her election may also blunt the rise of Sanseito, a right-wing populist party that surged in July on an anti-immigration platform. During the LDP leadership race, all five candidates promised tougher measures on foreigners. But Takaichi stood out for her rhetoric, vowing to crack down on rule-breaking visitors and immigrants.
She also cited unconfirmed anecdotes about tourists allegedly kicking sacred deer in her hometown of Nara, remarks that drew criticism. She later clarified she aimed to highlight the growing anxiety and anger among many Japanese about “outrageous” foreigners.
At home, Takaichi must rebuild public trust after years of scandal within her party. In 2022, revelations of some LDP lawmakers’ ties to the former Unification Church hurt the party’s reputation. The following year, several lawmakers were accused of failing to report income or disclose kickbacks, deepening public frustration.
Critics say Takaichi’s record on women’s rights is mixed and will be another test of her public appeal. She opposes allowing married women to keep separate surnames, and resists female succession in the imperial family. Still, during her 2025 campaign, she proposed tax breaks for babysitting and corporate incentives for in-house childcare, perhaps signs of a cautious shift toward more women-friendly policies.
Takaichi’s rise delivers a jolt to Japan’s political landscape. Poised, but far from assured, to become ﻿the country’s first woman prime minister, she’s also steering the LDP back toward its conservative roots after years of centrist leadership.
The question now is whether Takaichi’s election, and the LDP’s gamble on her, will revive the party’s fortunes or hasten its decline."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/us/atlanta-control-tower-evacuated,Atlanta air traffic control tower evacuated after fire alarm and gas smell,,,,CNN,"The air traffic control tower at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was evacuated for a time Friday night after a fire alarm and a gas smell were detected, according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration.
“Just keep taxiing V then F,” one controller told a pilot according to a recording by LiveATC.net. “Were evacuating, so we are going ATC Zero, so you can call the ramp when you get close.”
“ATC Zero” means that the FAA facility is not providing any air traffic control services.
“Everyone is going downstairs, so we’ll see what is happening here,” one controller told a pilot he was directing.
“The frequency is going to be unmanned for a while, because I have to evacuate as well,” the ground controller told pilots. “Just hold tight.”
A ground stop was issued for flights headed to the airport, forcing them to wait to take off. Some flights in the air were able to land, with assistance from the approach controllers that normally guide planes to the airport, but usually hands them off to the tower for landing.
“We actually just landed uncontrolled,” the pilot of a flight from Greensboro, South Carolina, told other pilots. “We’re just trying to see what to do next.”
“Nobody has taxied, landed or taken off other than you in the last 15 minutes,” another pilot said.
No planes took off, from what is typically the world busiest airport, between 5:11 p.m. and 5:52 p.m., according to FlightAware.  Only about five planes landed.
The Atlanta Fire Rescue Department investigated and gave the all-clear, according to an airport spokesperson.
Controllers returned to directing flights and takeoffs and landings resumed just before 6 p.m.
Air traffic controllers are considered essential employees and are required to work during the government shutdown, but won’t be paid until it’s over.
Staffing shortages have been reported at air traffic control facilities across the country this week as some controllers have stayed home, however Atlanta was not listed as short-staffed in Friday evening’s operations plan."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/world/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-intl,Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Venezuela’s María Corina Machado for keeping ‘the flame of democracy burning’,,,,CNN,"María Corina Machado , a Venezuelan opposition leader driven into hiding since a disputed election last year, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”
Machado received the accolade for tirelessly promoting democratic rights in Venezuela and “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday, announcing the award at a ceremony in Oslo.
Born in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, in 1967, Machado trained as an industrial engineer before entering politics. In 2002, she founded Súmate, a volunteer group that promotes political rights and monitors elections.
Machado has described her life’s work as promoting “ballots over bullets.” The Nobel committee lauded her as “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times.”
“Oh my god … I have no words,” Machado said after being woken in the middle of the night by a phone call from the committee to tell her she had won the prize.
In a statement accepting the award, Machado said the prize belongs to the people of Venezuela.
“It is a recognition of what we have achieved together and a reminder of what still remains,” she said, adding that it should act as an impetus for Venezuelans to complete their task of achieving freedom.
Although the White House criticized the Nobel committee for overlooking the peacemaking efforts of Donald Trump – who has long publicly coveted the prize – the US president praised Machado in January for “peacefully expressing the voices and the WILL of the Venezuelan people.”
On Friday, Trump said he spoke with Machado after the prize was announced, adding that she was “very nice” in their call. “The person who actually got the Nobel Prize called today, called me and said, ‘I’m accepting this in honor of you, because you really deserved it,’” the president said.
Machado, who mentioned the call earlier on Friday, told El País newspaper that Venezuelans are “deeply grateful” to the president.
Trump speaks with Nobel Peace prize winner Machado after his administration denounced the decision to award it to her
Earlier, she publicly thanked him on social media “for his decisive support of our cause.”
“We are on the threshold of victory, and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the people of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies in achieving freedom and democracy. Venezuela will be free!” she wrote on X.
Tensions between the US and Venezuela have escalated in recent weeks. CNN has previously reported that Trump is conducting a broad strategy aimed at weakening ﻿ President Nicolás Maduro, according to sources briefed on the administration’s plans.
Machado’s work has become more difficult over time. Freedom House, a monitoring group, says Venezuela’s democratic institutions have deteriorated since 1999 and “have grown sharply worse in recent years” due to a harsh crackdown by the Maduro government.
Machado attempted to run against Maduro in the 2024 presidential election, but her candidacy was voided by the regime. She then switched her support to the party of Edmundo González Urrutia, and worked to mobilize citizens and train election observers to try to ensure the vote was free and fair.
Both Maduro and González claimed victory after the vote. When Venezuela’s government-aligned electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner, with 51.95% of the vote, opposition forces cried foul. Analysts reported “suspicious” data patterns in the reported results. One expert said there was about a “one in 100 million chance that this particular pattern will occur by chance.”
After the election, Machado claimed she could prove that Maduro had lost “in a landslide to Edmundo, 67% to 30%.” Writing in the Wall Street Journal , she said her group had “receipts obtained directly from more than 80% of the nation’s polling stations.”
The Nobel committee praised Machado on Friday for making sure “the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy the ballots and lie about the outcome.” At the time, the Biden administration also concurred that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Maduro lost the vote.

After declaring victory, the Maduro government moved to crack down on dissent. Human Rights Watch, a monitoring group, said this year that the government has “killed, tortured, detained, and forcefully disappeared people seeking democratic change.”
As a result, Machado has lived in hiding in Venezuela since last year, resurfacing briefly during protests in January. Speaking to CNN from an unknown location in August 2024, Machado said the regime had “lost total touch with reality and lost its social base,” allowing her movement – with no resources, and operating under strict censorship – to mobilize “millions of Venezuelans” committed to democracy.
“Everyone in Venezuela is afraid of losing our freedom or even our lives,” she told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “But above all we are committed to make the truth prevail … and get a transition to democracy peacefully.”
The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded each year to the individual or organization which has done the most to satisfy the terms set out in the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist whose fortune established the Nobel Prizes.
The will says the award will be given to “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.”
Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said Machado had satisfied the full criteria.
“She has brought her country’s opposition together. She has never wavered in resisting the militarization of Venezuelan society. She has been steadfast in her support for a peaceful transition to democracy,” he said Friday.
González, Machado’s fellow opposition figure, said their movement is “very pleased” that the prize went to her.
“This prize recognizes peace, a fundamental element in our (2024) electoral campaign. During the campaign we made peace the core of our ambitions, so we could have a peaceful and ordered transition. This is what this award exemplifies in the person of Maria Corina Machado, an upright, brave and courageous political figure”
In selecting Machado as this year’s laureate, the committee signaled its concerns about the health of democracy worldwide, according to Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
“The Nobel Committee clearly chose to highlight democracy as a priority area, underscoring that this award comes at a time of global backsliding of democratic values and norms,” Haggag told CNN.
Nina Græger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said Machado’s award is “above all, a prize for democracy.”
Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Japan’s Nihon Hidankyo for efforts to rid world of nuclear weapons
“Research shows that democracy is an important precondition for peace. At a moment when authoritarianism is on the rise across the world, this award highlights the courage of those who defend freedom with ballots, not bullets,” she told CNN.
Analysts say the committee often uses the prize to send a message about areas of concern over the past year. The 2024 prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots Japanese organization of atomic bomb survivors, at a time when the world was once again confronting the specter of nuclear weapons, amid Russia’s threats during its war in Ukraine.
Friday’s award came after a months-long campaign of self-promotion by US President Donald Trump, who stressed repeatedly that he believed he deserved the prize for ending “unsolvable” wars during his second term.
Although Trump scored a major diplomatic victory this week in announcing the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, this likely came too late to influence the Nobel commitee. Nominations for this year’s prize closed on January 31, when Trump had only been in office for 11 days.
The White House nonetheless criticized the committee for snubbing Trump.
“President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives,” said communications director Steven Cheung. “The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.”
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had nominated Machado for the Peace Prize in 2024 when he was a US senator from Florida and while Venezuela was rocked by protests following its disputed presidential election. “Her tireless struggle for a free and just Venezuela is an inspiration and will always be remembered,” he wrote on X then.
The prize also comes at a time of rising antagonism between the United States and Venezuela, with the US military carrying out lethal strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, which the Trump administration has deemed to be “narco-trafficking” vessels.
Fact check: Trump’s absurd claim that he saved 100,000 lives by attacking alleged Venezuelan drug boats
The US has also deployed at least seven warships to the southern Caribbean and announced a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest. The Venezuelan president has faced formal drug trafficking charges from the Justice Department since 2020, which he denies.
The peace prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) and will be formally presented at a ceremony in Oslo in December.
Frydnes, the chair of the committee, could not confirm whether Machado will be able to attend.
“It’s a question of security. It’s too early to say. We always hope to have the laureate with us in Oslo, but this is a serious security situation which needs to be handled first,” Frydnes said.
CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon contributed to this report.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/qatar-air-force-facility-idaho,US announces it will allow Qatar to build an Air Force facility in Idaho,,,,CNN,"Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced on Friday that the US will allow Qatar to build an Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, which will host Qatari F-15 fighter jets and pilots who will train alongside US troops.
“The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase the lethality, interoperability,” Hegseth said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart Saoud bin Abdulrahman al-Thani at the Pentagon. “It’s just another example of our partnership. And I hope you know, Your Excellency, that you can count on us.”
The announcement of the deal comes just weeks after Trump signed an executive order for the US to guarantee the security of Qatar — a significant commitment to a non-NATO, Arab ally. Israel had bombed Qatar several days earlier as part of an operation against Hamas officials living in Doha. But sources told CNN that the plan to build the Qatari facility has been in the works for several years, dating back to the previous administration.
A US official said the agreement with Qatar is routine and something the Air Force has done for decades with other partner nations including Germany and Singapore.
Hegseth later on Friday wrote in a post on X, “The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today’s announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft,” emphasizing there will be no Qatari owned base in the US.
But a close ally of Donald Trump, far-right activist Laura Loomer, has posted on X more than a dozen times since the deal was announced calling it “outrageous,” “an abomination,” and a “betrayal.”
Hegseth praised Qatar for playing a “substantial role” in the peace talks that led to a ceasefire and hostage swap deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as the Gulf country’s support when the US struck Iranian nuclear sites in June. Qatar is also home to the largest US military base in the region at Al-Udeid.
The Qatar facility specifically has been in the works for several years; a 2022 announcement from Mountain Home Air Force Base, published while President Joe Biden was in office,  provided the results of an environmental assessment looking at the “potential impacts associated with the beddown of a US-led Qatar Emiri Air Force F-15QA squadron” at the base.
The “beddown” is facilities for the training squadron’s operations, the US official said, providing space for the pilots to train, brief, do their scheduling, and more. The countries who send pilots as part of this program provide the US funds through foreign military sales to build the facilities, the official added, and the military hires community labor around the bases to build them out.
The final environmental impact report published in 2022 said it was for “the beddown of 12 F-15QA permanently assigned QEAF aircraft and associated equipment, use of the Mountain Home Air Force Base airfield and special use airspace and military training routes for training, use of defensive countermeasures and ordnance, approximately 300 additional QEAF and United States Air Force personnel, and the construction and modification of facilities and infrastructure needed to support the beddown.”
The report said basing and operations were expected to begin in early Fiscal Year 2024, with an initial timeline of 10 years and an option to extend further if needed.
“We further welcome today’s signing of the letter of acceptance establishing a Qatar Emiri Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” al Thani said. “This step strengthens interoperabilities, enhances joint readiness, and advances our shared defense goals. Mr. Secretary, together we will continue to deepen this strategic partnership in pursuit of lasting peace and shared security.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/tech/ai-chatgpt-blue-collar-jobs,Your plumber has a new favorite tool: ChatGPT,,,,CNN,"The roughly 20 plumbers of Oak Creek Plumbing & Remodeling in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area don’t just bring toolkits with wrenches, pliers and Teflon tape to customers’ homes these days. They also bring a tablet equipped with the latest version of ChatGPT.
The technology helps those workers automatically create invoices, work proposals and even brainstorm how to address complicated plumbing problems, company president Dan Callies told CNN. All they have to do is take photos of a broken water heater, for example, or write their observations in a prompt, and ChatGPT spits out a list of recommendations.
“It’s definitely been worth the investment,” Callies said. “Some of our older guys have learned to ask ChatGPT the right questions, and they’re kind of amazed with some of answers it comes up with.”
From office work to on-the-ground troubleshooting, blue-collar businesses are increasingly embracing AI to boost productivity, cut down costs and even replace administrative support roles. Some use popular AI software such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, while others use platforms tailored specifically for the trades with AI capabilities, such as ServiceTitan and Housecall Pro.
“It’s affecting both sides of our company, out in the field and internally within our office,” Callies said.
No humans are involved from when a customer requests services from Gulfshore Air Conditioning & Heating in Niceville, Florida to when a technician arrives at their home, thanks to AI.
And once the technician arrives, they use AI to diagnose the issue and pull up technical information within seconds — a task that used to require sifting through as many as five 60-page manuals, said Krista Landen, the company’s marketing and IT manager.
A survey of more than 400 tradespeople across North America by Housecall Pro earlier this year found that more than 70% of respondents said they have tried AI tools and about 40% said they actively use them. Younger professionals are leading the charge, the survey showed, though older workers are testing the waters, too.
AI’s integration and impact varies by industry, according to the survey; Plumbers were the most likely to say AI has helped their business grow; cleaners were the “biggest adopters of AI”; while electricians had “the highest satisfaction rates” with the technology.
Schools have also taken notice: Jason Altmire, president and CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities, a trade association that represents more than 800 private vocational schools across the country, said several institutions are weaving AI into their curriculum in collaboration with employers.
“They want their graduates ready for jobs that are going to be available in the future, not jobs that were here five years ago,” Altmire said.
Still, some tradespeople are skeptical about how the new technology works and how it can be applied to physical tasks.
“There’s some hesitancy, so I wouldn’t say they’re all in,” said Edward McFarlane, chair of the board of directors at the Air Conditioning Contractors of America. “But the tide is definitely coming in.”
AI is slowly reshaping the economics of blue-collar America.
Businesses in the trades implementing AI are becoming more productive, allowing them to take on more projects or improve the quality of their services, said Laura Ullrich, an economist at job site Indeed.
“People go into the trades because they like doing the hands-on work itself, and if some of the administrative tasks can be automated, then that should help those workers lean into the parts of the job they like and do smarter work,” she said.
AI has already made a measurable impact on Gulfshore, which saw a $370,000 increase in revenue 30 days after upgrading to an AI marketing feature that automates campaigns.
The company said it also saw an increase of $150 in revenue per average ticket after implementing AI tools that helped technicians get through administrative tasks more quickly and allowed them to sell customers additional services or accessories. Landen said the higher revenue, if sustained, should eventually translate into higher compensation for technicians.
“We’ve been using these AI products since June, so we should start to see more of a benefit in order to roll out new compensation packages (for technicians) within the next six months,” she added.
Callies of Oak Plumbing & Remodeling said ChatGPT has allowed the company to “lower our overhead and provide better services or better value.”
AI’s growing adoption in the trades could mean businesses may not need to hire as many office workers for marketing and taking customer calls, economists and business owners tell CNN. That presents those businesses the opportunity to cut down on those costs.
For now, there’s broad agreement that AI is nowhere near taking away the jobs of technicians, at least not until robotic technology significantly advances. It’s mostly proving to be a useful tool for tradespeople.
“All of our technicians are running more efficiently, and they’re less stressed,” Landen said. “I feel like I am a real life Jetson living in the future.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/business/nvidia-china-ai-trade,"What is Nvidia, the world’s leading AI chipmaker entangled in US-China trade tensions?",,,,CNN,"Tech giant Nvidia is the world’s leading artificial-intelligence chipmaker, but the company’s success has also put it in the crossfire of trade tensions.
The Santa Clara, California-based company, which is approaching a market capitalization of $5 trillion, has seen rapid growth due to its chips, which are predominantly used to power massive data centers used by other tech firms, like OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT.
But Nvidia’s leading technology has been used as a negotiating tool in President Donald Trump’s trade spat with China, which was kickstarted by Trump’s sweeping tariffs in April and has escalated over rare earth mineral disputes .
It’s further complicated Nvidia’s relationship with China, where it was doing roughly 25% of its graphics processing unit sales, estimates Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. Nvidia’s popularity has also embroiled the company in a steep controversy for potentially allowing China to skirt around export restrictions as trade tensions continue.
“Nvidia has gotten caught in the middle of two very important things: a trade dispute between China and the United States … but more importantly, AI has become a matter of national security,” Luria said.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has argued that restricting sales of American AI chips will ultimately enable Chinese developers to create their own alternatives.
Huang, 62, was born in Taiwan, and at age 9 was sent by his parents to live in Tacoma, Washington. In 1993, the Oregon State and Stanford University grad co-founded Nvidia, which started as a graphics-based processing company.
Huang — who is worth $167 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — has been treated as a rockstar in Taiwan for his success in the AI chips race, and previously worked as a microprocessor designer at now-competitor AMD.
“It’s really unusual to have somebody who can go from starting what was at the time a very small tech startup and grow it to the extraordinary level of success that Nvidia has grown to,” John Villasenor, a nonresident senior fellow at Brookings Institution and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said of Huang.
Nvidia powers the data centers that support AI technology and has been the go-to provider of those chips.
Nvidia essentially created the architecture for anyone who develops AI, leading to a surge in demand for its technology, according to Arun Sundararajan, a professor of technology, operations and statistics at NYU Stern School of Business.
The company said in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and provide it with data center chips as soon as late 2026.
Nvidia is competing with AMD for deals with partners like OpenAI, which said Monday it would use 6 gigawatts of AMD chips to power OpenAI’s data centers.
“The competition has undeniably arrived. Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world’s most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We’ll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNN.
In recent years, the US government has sought to restrict Chinese access to American technology to slow Beijing’s progress on AI, thus allowing the United States to take the lead. Trump continued the trend in April, when he restricted China’s access to chips, including Nvidia’s H20, as part of his trade war.
Such restrictions on the sale of chips offended China, Luria said, and ultimately led to Beijing limiting the purchase of chips to their companies.
But the White House recently reversed their position.
“You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in July.
Trump in August greenlit sales of chips to China in an agreement with US chipmakers. Nvidia and AMD, Trump said, would give 15% of revenue from China sales to the US in exchange for export licenses . That includes giving China access to Nvidia’s H20 chips, which were released in 2024 to maintain access to the Chinese market following strict export controls .
But Beijing seemed unimpressed and trade tensions have only escalated since the start of a tit-for-tat trade war in April.
China has since increased import restrictions on US chips, including Nvidia’s processors. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he would impose a 100% tariff on China “over and above any Tariff they are currently paying” beginning November 1 over export controls on rare earth minerals.
“Where this all gets resolved is unclear,” Luria said, because China believes “that stopping the sale of Nvidia chips into China creates some leverage on the US in the negotiation.”
Commerce Department officials are investigating whether Nvidia’s customer, Singapore-based Megaspeed, is helping China sidestep export restrictions for access to Nvidia’s tech, according to a report from the New York Times . CNN has not independently verified the Times’ reporting.
“We have engaged with the U.S. government regarding Megaspeed, performed our own inquiry, and have not identified any reason to believe products have been diverted. NVIDIA visited multiple Megaspeed sites yet again earlier this week and confirmed what we previously observed—Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules. The Administration’s AI Action plan rightly encourages businesses worldwide to embrace U.S. standards and U.S. leadership, benefitting national and economic security,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNN.
And Nvidia’s H20 chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek , an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood.
China could also gain access to the chips on the black market, since another country could buy Nvidia’s chips and resell them to China, Sundararajan said.
“The bigger issue is if we push harder to restrict global access to Nvidia’s products, can that be counterproductive? Because it forces these countries to speed up their own pace of innovation,” Sundararajan said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/economy/trump-china-tariff-threats-economy,Trump announces 130% tariffs on China. The global trade war just came roaring back,,,,CNN,"President Donald Trump announced he will impose an additional 100% tariff on goods from China, on top of the 30% tariffs already in effect, starting November 1 or sooner. The threat is a massive escalation after months of a trade truce between the two nations.
“The United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Friday afternoon. “Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.”
Trump’s announcement is tied to Beijing ramping up export controls on its critical rare earths, which are needed to produce many electronics. As a result, Trump appeared to call off a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that was scheduled for later this month in South Korea.
Trump’s initial message Friday, delivered via a Truth Social post, in which he threatened “massive” new tariffs, was ill received by investors on Friday as fears of a spring déjà vu, when tariffs on Chinese goods soared to a stunning 145%, set in. Markets closed sharply lower on Friday after Trump’s initial comments, with the Dow falling by 878 points, or 1.9%. The S&P 500 was down 2.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 3.5%.
While Trump doesn’t always act on his threats, investors, consumers and businesses still have reason to worry.
The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Although Mexico has recently replaced China as the top source of foreign goods shipped to the United States, America depends on China for hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods. Meanwhile, China is one of the top export markets for America.
In particular, electronics, apparel and furniture are among the top goods the United States receives from China. Trump has pushed CEOs, especially in tech, to move production to the United States, but he’s softened his approach in recent months as business leaders have satisfied the president with announcements of hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in US manufacturing — even if they continue to make the bulk of their products overseas.
Shortly after imposing minimum 145% tariffs on Chinese goods — an effective embargo on trade, Trump issued an exemption for electronics , making them subject to 20% tariffs instead. The move was, in many ways, an acknowledgment that the Trump administration understood the pain he was inflicting on the US economy through his sky-high tariffs.
Then, in May, US and Chinese officials further established the interdependence of trade by agreeing to lower tariffs on one another. China brought levies on American exports down to 10% from 125%, and the United States brought rates down to 30% from 145%.
Both countries’ stock markets rallied as a result.
Trump on Friday claimed trade hostility from China “came out of nowhere.” But in reality, it’s been bubbling up for months.
For the United States, a critical part of trade agreements has been to ensure China will increase its supply of rare earth magnets. Yet despite several apparent breakthroughs, Trump has in recent months repeatedly accused China of violating the terms.
Trump first responded by putting restrictions on sales of American technologies to China, including a key Nvidia AI chip. Many of these restrictions were later lifted.
Then came the Trump administration’s announcement that it would soon impose fees on goods transported on Chinese-owned or -operated ships. China countered with a similar plan on American ships that took effect Friday.
In short: Trump has already demonstrated there’s no limit to how high he’ll go with tariffs on China, and Xi has shown no mercy in how he chooses to retaliate.
But Trump’s ability to continue to impose tariffs on a whim could soon end, pending the verdict in a landmark case kicking off in the Supreme Court next month. Xi, however, faces no such constraints."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/europe/france-lecornu-macron-political-turmoil-latam-intl,"In shock move, French president reappoints prime minister who quit Monday",,,,CNN,"French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu to his post, despite accepting his resignation Monday following the collapse of his overnight government.
“The president of the republic has named Mr Sébastien Lecornu prime minister and has charged him with forming a government,” the Élysée Palace said in a statement Friday.
In a post on X mapping out his thoughts on the government he will form, Lecornu said: “We must put an end to this political crisis that is exasperating the French people and to this instability that is detrimental to France’s image and its interests.”
He was a surprise choice, rounding off a rollercoaster week in French politics.
Late Sunday, Lecornu announced his cabinet, before it was publicly criticized by his interior minister that same night. On Monday morning, he submitted his resignation – which was accepted – before Macron reversed course and asked him to quarterback the selection of his successor in a 48-hour blitz round of talks with political opponents.
Despite those efforts, for Macron, the solution to the domino-like collapse of recent prime ministers was apparently simple: more of the same.
That decision was met with anger from his opponents.
The president of the far-right National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, blasted the decision as “a bad joke, a democratic disgrace, and a humiliation for the French people,” in a post on X following the announcement.
The far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen – currently out of political office pending an appeal for campaign finance irregularities – called to immediately vote out Lecornu’s as-of-yet unannounced government and to have new elections, in a post on X.
On the far-left, Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the France Unbowed party, ridiculed Lecornu’s reappointment, adding, “Macron can do nothing other than Macron.”
The political paralysis around assembling a cabinet and passing a budget has earned France unwelcome comparisons to European countries like Italy, with reputations for political instability.
Lecornu appeared to have negotiated a safeguard against further political unrest.
In his X post on Friday, he flagged an apparent compromise he had agreed to: that any issues raised in the past days’ consultations with party leaders would be open to parliamentary debate. In his second term, Macron has repeatedly forced legislation through the National Assembly without a vote.
This isn’t especially surprising. Ahead of his disastrous cabinet announcement last Sunday, Lecornu had already waved off using this power to sidestep the French parliament again.
But Lecornu did have one surprise to share.
“All ambitions are legitimate and useful, but those who join the Government must commit to disengaging themselves from the presidential ambitions for 2027,” he wrote on X.
Former French President Sarkozy will go to prison
The move will likely exclude figures like Bruno Retailleau, the right-wing former interior minister, who is expected to run in 2027. Similarly, leaders of the far-left and far-right parties will be excluded from government, perhaps unsurprisingly, as both parties’ leaderships, including Le Pen if her appeal is successful, are expected to stand against Macron’s would-be centrist successor.
While Lecornu hasn’t yet revealed his cabinet, the final consultations with the president Friday were with Macron’s central bloc and the traditional left and right-wing parties. The far-left and far-right were excluded from discussions.
Lecornu faced broad criticism for his choice of ministers in Sunday night’s cabinet. After promising a break with the past two prime ministers, amid a divided political landscape in France, he announced a ministerial selection that featured more Macron allies than in the president’s very first cabinet in 2017.
Lecornu took nearly a month to name his first short-lived cabinet. Many in France will be closely following his choice of colleagues second-time round."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/investing/us-stock-market,Dow falls nearly 900 points after Trump reignites trade war between the world’s two largest economies,,,,CNN,"US stocks closed sharply lower Friday after President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on imports from China, reigniting fears of a trade war that rocked global markets earlier this year.
The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%. The broader S&P 500 dropped 2.71% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.56%.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each posted their worst day since April as a slide in tech stocks led the market lower. The Dow posted its worst day since May. The S&P 500’s drop of 2.71% saw the index shed roughly $1.56 trillion in market value in one day, according to FactSet data.
Trump said in a social media post he is considering a “massive increase” in tariffs on imports from China, adding “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive’” over rare earth exports.
His latest threat stems from accusations that China is imposing export controls on rare earths, slow-walking previous agreements to free them up for US businesses. Because of that, Trump said he no longer sees a need to meet with President Xi Jinping later this month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.
Trump threatens economic retaliation on China amid escalating dispute over critical rare earths
US stocks had been hovering near record highs . Wall Street in recent months has tried to look past concerns about tariffs, instead focusing on better-than-expected corporate earnings.
The president’s post on Truth Social jolted markets, sending Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, soaring by 32% to its highest level since June.
“That was clearly not something traders wanted to hear!” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note. “We’d become quite accustomed to relatively quiescent markets with an upward bias, so it was quite shocking to see stocks in a quick freefall.”
AI and chip stocks that are sensitive to developments in US-China trade relations dropped lower. Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) fell 4.95% and 7.78%, respectively.
“The ramping up of tensions with China is the big story,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird. “It definitely caught markets off guard.”
Wall Street in recent weeks has also been worried about valuations of AI and tech stocks, leaving them more vulnerable to a surprise.
“When you have a shock like today with President Trump, they are going to get hit the most because they’re the most at risk to the economic outlook worsening or corporate earnings retreating due to a potential slowdown,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.
Meanwhile, US-based rare earth mining and processing companies jumped higher. USA Rare Earth ( USAR ) and MP Materials ( MP ) gained 4.96% and 8.37%, respectively.
US Treasuries rallied as investors rushed into safer assets amid market volatility and concerns that a reignited trade war could hit economic growth.
10-year and 30-year Treasury yields fell as investors scooped up bonds.
Gold and silver, which are considered safe havens amid turmoil, rose 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively.
“Trump is sparking risk-off sentiments in markets after declaring the potential for massive tariff hikes on China,” Torres said. “Investors are clamoring for safe haven holdings as a heavy increase in levies could weigh on the earnings picture and the economic outlook ahead.”
US oil prices slumped 4.2% and Brent crude dropped 3.8% to their lowest levels since May.
Oil prices had been trading lower earlier in part due to ceasefire developments between Israel and Hamas.
Robert Yawger, commodity specialist at Mizuho Securities, said the flare-up in tensions between Trump and Xi stoked concerns of a “demand destruction event,” where a trade war weighs on economic growth and demand for oil.
“It’s a mini mirror image of what happened in April,” Yawger said, referring to the slump in oil prices in the spring when investors were raising forecasts of a possible recession.
CNN’s Fear and Greed index dropped from “neutral” into “fear” for the first time since May.
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each turned into the red for the month.
“The sell-off has the potential to evolve into a larger correction, especially if the US-China trade truce is over,” Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in an email. “Throughout the summer, greed has far outpaced fear in the US equity market, and the high level of complacency leaves investors vulnerable.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/weather/storm-priscilla-raymond-southwest-flood-forecast-arizona-phoenix-climate,Arizona and Southwest face a big flood threat thanks to Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Storm Raymond,,,,CNN,"A serious multi-day flood threat is underway in the Southwest as two former tropical systems turn the typically dry desert into a breeding ground for heavy rain.
Soaking rainfall began over the region Thursday night as increasingly humid air arrived. Parts of the Phoenix metro had picked up a half-inch or more of rain by early Friday afternoon, with higher totals of 1 to 3 inches in the mountains north of there.
Flood watches cover parts of six states, with the bull’s-eye of the most serious flood concern in central and northeastern Arizona and southwest Utah now into Saturday morning. That’s where a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall has been issued, according to the Weather Prediction Center. This means “numerous flash flooding events” are possible, some of which could be “significant,” the WPC said .
Former Hurricane Priscilla is helping to vault a record level of moisture for this time of year over the region, priming the atmosphere to produce rainfall totals from 1 to 4 inches. Combine that with the region’s mix of dry desert ground and mountainous terrain, and it’s a perfect recipe for rainfall to runoff quickly and trigger flooding.
Rainfall totals in a day or two could be nearly double the entire October average in Phoenix and Flagstaff. Phoenix typically sees about a half-inch in the month, while Flagstaff averages an inch and a half.
Washes, small streams and creeks and slot canyons could fill with rushing water and some could flood outside their banks during this event, so it’s best to avoid these areas. Recent wildfire burn scars could also see flooding and debris flows.
Most flood deaths occur on flooded roadways, since just 12 inches of water can float a car away.
Most flood fatalities occur in vehicles, and it only takes 12 inches of water to sweep a car away. During a flood, small decisions like turning around and not driving through a flooded roadway, not driving around barricades, and delaying travel until conditions improve, can… pic.twitter.com/3qnWKPDwTB
Serious flooding like what happened in 2018 because of a similar forecast instigated by remnants of Hurricane Rosa could happen in the region, the WPC said. Numerous water rescues unfolded in Phoenix then after 2.36 inches of rain fell during a single day, the city’s wettest October day on record.
The threat stretches beyond Arizona. Areas from southeast California to southern Utah, southwest Colorado and western New Mexico also have an elevated risk of flooding into Saturday.
The flood threat will carry on into Sunday and Monday from a new tropical player arriving on the region’s doorstep.
Tropical Storm Raymond will fall apart by Sunday near northwest Mexico, but much like with Priscilla, its moisture will keep trucking north toward Arizona, New Mexico and southwest Texas.
The heaviest rain from this second round is expected to fall a bit farther east than what’s to come Friday into Saturday morning. Southeast Arizona, southern New Mexico and southwest Texas have the greatest risk of flash flooding from Saturday night through Sunday and Monday, including Tucson, Arizona, and El Paso, Texas.
It’s all happening in part because the remnants of former Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Storm Raymond are juicing up the typically dry desert air over the Southwest US.
Think of the amount of moisture in the atmosphere like the amount of water in a sponge. The more there is, the more that can be wrung out by storms.
Priscilla dissipated Friday to the west of Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula. However, its moisture-rich air has been scooped up by a weather system riding through a dip in the jet stream along the West Coast.
Moisture and energy from Tropical Storm Raymond will play copycat and get steered by the same weather system into Mexico and the Southwest, although a bit farther east than Priscilla.
This is a classic weather pattern that has historically been responsible for slingshotting Eastern Pacific hurricane remnants into the Southwest US where they can trigger flooding rain. But seeing it happen in back-to-back fashion like this is a bit more unusual."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-case-explained,What to know about the Letitia James case and what happens next,,,,CNN,"New York Attorney General Letitia James’ indictment Thursday was the second major achievement in the aggressive pressure campaign by the White House to prosecute President Donald Trump’s political foes.
The five-page indictment accuses James of making false statements on a loan application to receive favorable terms, allegations that she denies. She is scheduled to appear in court on October 24.
The Justice Department’s formal investigation into James started earlier this year after the president called her a “wacky crook,” and hit a boiling point last month when Trump publicly called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute her, saying she and others like California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff are “guilty as hell.”
Trump’s push for the case has critics worried the Justice Department is increasingly under the president’s personal command, as he vociferously challenges prosecutors to target his opponents while turning away from cases that may not align with his interests.
The allegations against James focus on a mortgage agreement the New York Democrat signed in 2020 to purchase a house in Norfolk, Virginia.
James allegedly stated in loan documents that she would use the property as her secondary residence – a claim that prosecutors say won her favorable loan terms but was in fact a lie as she instead rented it out to a family.
Her misrepresentation violated her mortgage agreement, prosecutors say, which barred James from renting out the property.
Prosecutors allege James improperly saved $18,933 because the interest rate on a mortgage for a second home is lower than interest rates on a loan for an investment property. The lower interest rate and another credit, they allege, account for the savings.
The first count James faces, bank fraud, charges her with scheming to defraud two financial institutions: OVM Financial, which helped James apply for the loan, and First Savings Bank, which was assigned to the loan.
Could Trump’s prosecutions of foes like Comey and James backfire?
The second count charges James with lying to OVM Financial about her plans to rent the house.
A person familiar with the James property told CNN that members of her family are living at the home. The person added there is no rental agreement, James never relinquished control of the property and she has made all the mortgage payments.
She faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted.
James will make her first appearance in court later this month, during which she will be presented with the charges against her. Prosecutors could ask the judge assigned to oversee the case to impose conditions for her release, though such conditions are not common when defendants aren’t accused of violent crimes or at risk of fleeing.
As the case progresses, James’ attorneys will have the opportunity to challenge the prosecution before it goes to trial.
Her attorneys have not yet said what motions they plan to file, but have indicated that they see the indictment as political in nature and said in a statement to CNN that the case “is driven by President Trump’s desire for revenge.”
The probe into James began in April when Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department over claims that she may have engaged in mortgage fraud when purchasing two different homes – a Brooklyn brownstone she purchased decades ago and the house in Norfolk in 2023.
And while prosecutors investigated Pulte’s allegations on the two additional homes, Thursday’s indictment made clear they were zeroing in on a third property, another house in Norfolk, that she purchased in 2020.
That house, which is at issue in the indictment, was not included in Pulte’s referral.
James’ attorneys were caught off guard when they learned that the charges in the indictment did not focus on the two properties that Pulte had included in his referral, sources familiar with their reaction told CNN.
They had previously pushed back on Pulte’s claims, even passing documents along to the DOJ they said refute the “threadbare” accusations.
Prosecutors for months investigated Pulte’s allegations – one of whom, special prosecutor Ed Martin, even posed for pictures in front of her Brooklyn home. The prosecutors working on the case concluded there was not enough evidence to charge her with intentionally lying on her loan paperwork, CNN reported .
In fact, the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia was pushed out of his role because of his resistance from Pulte, Martin and the White House to bring any charges.
His replacement, former Trump aide Lindsey Halligan presented the case to the grand jury soon after accepting the job. Halligan previously secured a grand jury indictment into another Trump enemy, former FBI Director James Comey. Comey has pleaded not guilty.
According to sources, Halligan did not give Bondi or other DOJ leaders in Washington a heads-up about the timing of the James indictment.
The president has publicly, and repeatedly, stated that he hopes those who prosecuted him should face the same justice system he did during and after his first term.
James campaigned for New York attorney general pledging she would investigate Trump’s real estate business, which she did. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump peppered his speeches with criticisms of James saying she should be prosecuted.
The case against James seems to fill that desire – and mirrors the civil fraud case she brought in state court against him, his sons and business in 2022, in which she accused Trump of fraudulently inflated the value of his properties on his financial statements to get better rates from banks and insurers.
James’ alleged that Trump’s inflated property values were used to bolster his net worth and allowed him to qualify for a personal guarantee loan versus obtaining a commercial loan, which would carry a higher interest rate.
A New York judge found Trump liable for fraud. Trump is appealing.
After the James indictment was reported Thursday, Trump’s allies rushed to use another of James’ strategies against her: online messaging.
Within minutes, conservative figures were reposting years-old social media messages, including slogans that James wrote during the Trump case.
Halligan, the newly minted US attorney in Virginia’s eastern district, repeated one in her first public statement after securing the indictment: “No one is above the law.”"

In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.
In this chaotic world of busy schedules, stressful current events and personal responsibilities, growing distracted from your internal world is common.
Whether intentional or not, “people may believe they are ‘fine’ while functioning on autopilot, overworking or numbing with social media doom scrolling , food, alcohol or even checking out with excessive sleep,” said Dr. Urszula Klich, a clinical psychologist in Atlanta, via email.
That’s why this World Mental Health Day, Klich and other experts recommend taking a moment to dig deep and ask yourself, “How am I really ?”
Smart wellness goals are backed by science-based studies. Be part of one
Maintaining clear awareness of your mental well-being is essential for prevention and balance, Klich said. “Self-awareness helps us detect stress or emotional imbalance early, allowing adjustment,” she added. “Being self-aware is part of emotional intelligence — a kind of emotional literacy for knowing what you feel. Understanding why is another part of the puzzle, but one we can’t even begin to take if we don’t recognize we are having problems.”
How can you learn how you’re doing? It can be as simple as making a point to be mindful of your experiences throughout your day, journaling on a regular basis or finding and talking with a therapist.
More structured and clinically validated mental health screenings, which aren’t intended to give diagnoses, are available on the website of Mental Health America , a nonprofit promoting mental health and illness prevention through education, research and advocacy.
CNN  talked to several mental health experts, and these are some factors they suggested you consider in your self-assessment. They also shared thoughts about what to do if you think you need help.
Nobody feels perfectly happy or content all the time. Temporarily feeling mildly stressed or low due to changes in your personal life, your work life or in the world is normal, and that feeling can briefly affect your sleep, motivation or mood, Klich said.
Nevada, Arizona and Alabama rank lowest in nation for mental health. Where your state lands
Everyone occasionally experiences these transient aspects of the human condition, said Dr. Ken Duckworth, chief medical officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness and author of “ You Are Not Alone : The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health — With Advice From Experts and Wisdom From Real People and Families.”
You may be able to handle that kind of situation yourself by talking to a friend, going for a run, journaling or choosing another healthy habit that helps you feel better, Klich added.
What if it’s not temporary? When symptoms persist beyond two weeks and affect your ability to function and enjoy life, it’s time to pay more attention, Duckworth and Klich said. Experiencing a cluster of symptoms rather than one or two should also be concerning, said Theresa Nguyen, a licensed clinical social worker and chief research officer at Mental Health America.
“Finding life anxiety-provoking is a normal human experience,”   Duckworth said. But if you can’t bounce back from those feelings and find you often can’t parent properly, get your work done, get out of bed, follow through on plans with friends or eat properly, you should talk with your doctor or a therapist about your issues and ways to manage them, Duckworth added. Also, pay attention to any loved ones telling you they have noticed changes in your mood or behavior.
“People often say that relationship problems are the precipitating factors that lead them to look at mental health issues,” Nguyen said.
Cognitive shuffling: A mental trick to help you quiet racing thoughts and fall asleep
Additionally, how resilient are you? Do you sit and wallow for a long time or allow yourself to feel your emotions for a short time and then make any needed changes to deal with life? Your answer to that can also be telling.
“If you are concerned about a mood disorder, ask yourself if you can try to maintain daily routines such as sleeping, eating, getting outside or communicating with others, as structure can stabilize functioning,” Klich said. “Involve supportive family or friends for accountability and encouragement.”
A health professional can also rule out underlying medical conditions, she added, since those can sometimes appear to be mental health ones.
What if you feel you’re in real bad shape? Indicators that your mental health is more dire can include experiencing worsening impairment, frequently abandoning responsibilities to loved ones, using substances to cope, not maintaining hygiene, putting your safety at risk or feeling unrelenting feelings of hopelessness, despair or suicidal ideation, Klich said. Psychosis — marked by hallucinations, delusions or loss of reality — is another sign.
“Appropriate help is vital if mental health issues are escalating, and severe symptoms rarely improve without structured support,” Klich said. “It can literally become life or death or, in the least, result in severe relationship and work disruptions. If you have signs that your life is feeling out of control or have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, it is vital to get a comprehensive evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Medication management and therapy can help.”
Why schizophrenia may be ‘the most devastating of mental illnesses’
The sooner you seek help, the less likely you’ll need hospitalization, Klich added.
In this case, maintaining healthy sleep and eating patterns as best you can is also critical. Regardless of your situation, other practices that can keep you mentally healthy are regularly engaging with whatever helps you feel purpose in life, taking breaks from technology , spending time in spaces and with things that relax you, and practicing mindfulness or breath work , experts said.
Government and nonprofit organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom have multiple resources for mental health support , such as specialized helplines and treatment locators.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/weather/noreaster-storm-east-new-york-climate,"Potent nor’easter will slam the East Coast with fierce wind, major coastal flooding and rain this weekend",,,,CNN,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is no longer being updated. Click here for the latest forecast.
A powerful nor’easter is about to bring nasty weather to millions along the East Coast, with fierce winds, drenching rain and dangerous seas expected this weekend into early next week.
The storm will drive major coastal flooding and beach erosion alongside the heavy rain and potentially damaging wind. This disruptive weather will likely lead to travel headaches in the East and could be a nightmare for major airport hubs like Washington, DC, New York City and Boston.
The nor’easter is expected to develop just offshore along a stalled front draped over the Southeast on Saturday and spread hazardous weather along the coast from the Carolinas to the Northeast through the weekend.
A nor’easter is just a coastal storm named based on the direction from which its winds slam into the coast: northeast. Nor’easters are notorious snow producers in winter, but they can happen at any time of year, bringing heavy rain instead. They’re most frequent between September and April and usually develop between Georgia and New Jersey. The strongest nor’easters are also being supercharged by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution, a July study found.
This nor’easter looks to pack a punch, and the area from North Carolina through New Jersey and into coastal southern New England will bear the brunt of the storm’s disruptions.
A state of emergency will go into effect for New Jersey Saturday night ahead of the storm’s worst impacts, acting Gov. Tahesha Way announced Friday.
“I urge all New Jerseyans to exercise caution, monitor local weather forecasts and warnings, stay informed on evacuation protocols, and remain off the roads unless absolutely necessary,” Way said in a statement.
After developing Saturday somewhere off the coast between Florida and South Carolina, it will strengthen on Sunday while hugging coastal North Carolina.
Up to half a foot of rain could fall near the North Carolina coast, paired with gusty winds up to 50 mph. The nor’easter will also contribute to ongoing beach erosion in the state’s Outer Banks, where at least nine unoccupied homes have collapsed into the Atlantic since September 30 due to intense wave action and erosion from recent storms.
North Carolina homes collapse amid high surf from storms
The disruptive weather will stretch farther north Sunday and Monday with several inches of rain possible along the rest of the mid-Atlantic coast and into southern New England. Any areas caught under multiple rounds of this drenching rain could see localized flash flooding.
Powerful winds will accompany this rain with prolonged gusts of 40 to 50 mph possible. Winds will start whipping up along the Southeast coast Friday, maxing out later Saturday into Sunday for much of the mid-Atlantic coast. Some of the strongest gusts for New Jersey and southern New England will occur Sunday into Monday and could reach 60 mph at times.
Power outages are possible as these strong winds batter coastal areas for days. They could also stretch further inland to more heavily populated areas.
A significant coastal flooding event will also unfold from the Outer Banks through the Northeast with tide levels this weekend just shy of their highest marks of the month. The combination of soaking rain and strong winds pushing water onshore will be potent: Dozens of coastal spots from North Carolina to New York are expected to reach moderate-to-major flood stage from this nor’easter.
In Delaware and New Jersey – particularly the southern part of the state – coastal flooding could get bad enough to cause some roads to become impassible and some structures to flood, according to the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey.
Water levels could rise above 8 feet Atlantic City, New Jersey, – the highest level since Sandy in 2012 – and enter major flood stage on Sunday afternoon. That’s enough to trigger widespread flooding of roads in the area with some neighborhoods potentially becoming cut off due to the water, according to NOAA .
The nor’easter will also drive turbulent seas and generate rough surf that will make swimming dangerous for hundreds of miles of coastline.
After the storm moves away from the coast later Monday into Tuesday, the East could get a brief reprieve from the dreary weather. Then, yet another batch of unseasonable heat is expected to set in by late next week.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/business/build-a-bear-ceo-interview,How ‘kidulting’ helped make Build-a-Bear a Wall Street darling,,,,CNN,"Build-A-Bear Workshop, the nearly 30-year-old toy brand, is having a breakout moment, eclipsing some of Wall Street’s biggest winners by targeting customers across a broad age range.
The toy company’s revenue grew 11% in the second quarter to a record $124.2 million, and it even raised full-year guidance – all while mitigating the cost of tariffs. That’s a stark contrast to years of unprofitability before 2012.
Investors have taken notice. In the last year alone, Build-A-Bear’s stock is up 76%. In the last five years, the toy company’s share price ( BBW ) has risen nearly 2,000% – besting even tech companies riding the AI boom like Palantir, Nvidia and Microsoft.
But the company faces potential headwinds, including the impact of tariffs and increasingly squeezed consumers, who might pare back on non-essentials as they tighten budgets while inflation stays hot.
Build-A-Bear broadened its customer base beyond kids and capitalized on customer trends that emerged after the pandemic, focusing on experiences and tapping into what Sharon Price John, the company’s CEO, calls the “nostalgia economy.”
“’Kidulting,’ (is) adults wanting to be kids, and they’re buying things that they loved when they were kids. So we leaned into that with really interesting licenses that played on their memory,” John told CNN.
Build-A-Bear has licensing deals with nostalgic brands like Hello Kitty, Pokémon and Harry Potter. John said adults and teens are now 40% of the company’s business.
“A lot of the adults with kids also have fond memories of Build-A-Bear themselves,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. “So they’ve been keen to expose their kids to that. It’s a memory that they have and are fond of, and they’re keen to recreate that for a new generation.”
For parents, the fusion of entertainment and product from picking out and building a bear is valuable, as is Build-A-Bear’s price point, especially for birthday bears that cost a customer’s age.
“That’s very helpful to the retailer because we are in an era where money’s a bit tighter. People are thinking about what represents value, and Build-A-Bear has a proposition that’s really centered around value,” said Saunders.
And while many mall brands have faded, Build-A-Bear is growing. The company announced it would open 60 stores this year, 10 more than previously announced.
“Malls are still a big part of what we do, but that’s almost 30-40% of our retail environment,” said John. “Now we’re in tourist locations, cruise ships, hospitality and we also built out our e-commerce business. We had to participate in the digital economy.”
Like most toy companies, the company said tariffs will take a bite: an expected $11 million this year, despite front-loading component imports from China and Vietnam, which have 30% and 20% tariffs respectively.
The brand has controlled price hikes for now but expects to raise them at some point, albeit in specific spots rather than across-the-board, John said.
“I think that that has pleased investors because they’ve said, well, yes, there may be some downside on tariffs here, but it’s significantly less than maybe it is elsewhere in the toy sector,” said Saunders.
And as Americans face tighter wallets in the face of inflation, non-essentials – like Build-A-Bear’s product – could get cut from family budgets. Inflation has remained above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target for years, and a stagnating labor market has reignited fears that more families could see their incomes shrink.
Saunders also cited concerns about slowing foot traffic at shopping malls – and the chance that the current collectibles craze could go the way of Beanie Babies and Cabbage Patch kids in years past.
“Some of these (worries) may not materialize in the near-term, but the company needs to be alert to all of them,” said Saunders."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/world/palestinians-returning-gaza-city-intl,"Thousands of Palestinians are returning home to northern Gaza, finding destruction and heartbreak",,,,CNN,"Thousands of Palestinians began the long, dusty walk from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City after a ceasefire came into effect in the enclave on Friday. They found their city lying in ruins – yet were relieved to be returning home.
Virtually the whole population of northern Gaza had been displaced since Hamas’ attack on October 7, 2023, led to Israel’s war in the enclave, and the area has been reduced to rubble over the past two years.
Aerial footage shows vast stretches of land with nothing but ruins. There’s no infrastructure, no electricity and no running water.
Yet for many of those making the trek on Friday, there is no question about returning.
“I pray that God relieves our sorrow and distress and that people return to their homes. Even if the houses are destroyed, we will return, God willing,” said Ahmad Abu Watfa.
Abu Watfa spoke to CNN on his way back home to Sheikh Radwan in Gaza City. He said he was feeling an overwhelming joy, even though he knew that it’s likely that nothing awaits him that he could call home.
“There is no feeling more beautiful than this — the feeling of people returning from the south to the north,” he said.
An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said that people were allowed to move from the south to the north via the coastal Al-Rashid Street and the Salah al-Din Road in the center of the Gaza Strip.
For many residents of northern Gaza, Friday marked the second time they tried to return home.
While Israel forced most residents of northern Gaza to leave the area early in the war, it briefly allowed people to return to some parts during the last ceasefire in January.
But that homecoming was short lived for most, as Israel once again ordered a complete evacuation of Gaza City in early September, ahead of a ground invasion into the city.
The IDF told CNN at that time that 640,000 people have left the city after the evacuation order. That number represented about 90% of Gaza City’s pre-war population, although it was not possible to verify that estimate.
The situation in Gaza City was critical even before that ground offensive, with no fully functioning hospitals and few places to shelter.
On Friday, medical teams from the Al Rantisi hospital in Gaza City returned to the facility to find it completely destroyed. Gaza’s deputy minister of health, Dr Yousef Abu Al Rish, shared a video from the scene with CNN that showed ruins and burned and destroyed medical equipment.
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a United Nations-backed initiative, said that famine took hold of Gaza City in August and has since spread to the rest of the strip.
As people began to return to the north, grim discoveries awaited them there. Footage from the city shows many multistory buildings completely flattened and others ripped apart by blasts. The whole area appears to be covered in grey dust, with mostly no other color visible.
Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa hospital in the north, told CNN that the bodies of at least 33 Palestinians have been recovered from Gaza City on Friday, after the Israeli military withdrew from some areas of the city.
He said that it was impossible to identify some of the bodies, which is why they were sent to the hospital where forensic teams could examine them.
Majdi Fuad Mohammad Al-Khour was standing amid the rubble of what used to be his house in Tal el Hawa when he spoke to CNN.
He said two of his children – a son and a daughter – were killed in the war. His house was destroyed and nearly everything he ever owned is gone.
“Forty years of work to build this home,” he said. “I am 70 years old now. Since I was 10, I worked until I could marry, build this house, and have children. Now I cannot work, and my health does not allow me to. Where should I go? My health is no longer what it was when I was young. I am old and sick, and I cannot work. My wife is also sick and cannot see with her eyes.”
The Israeli military said on Friday that a ceasefire was now in effect in Gaza, with forces pulling back in accordance with the plan that was approved by the Israeli government.
Under the ceasefire agreement, a 72-hour period for the release of the hostages held by Hamas started Friday. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed as part of the agreement.
Israel says ceasefire in effect as troops withdraw from parts of Gaza
Sair Hikmat Subh from Beit Lahiya, a town just north of Gaza City said he was “tired and fed up” but hoping to return home soon.
Subh spoke to CNN as he was dismantling and packing up his tent near Al-Rashid Street ahead of his trip north.
“We are happy that the roadblock has been removed. Praise be to God for everyone’s safety. Of course I am happy!” he told CNN.
However, he said that experience taught him to be cautious.
“I have dismantled many tents and left many behind. I have been displaced nearly 20 times,” he said.
Subh was likely correct to be cautious. The IDF spokesperson said on Friday that Israeli troops would still be present in various areas of Gaza, including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Shuja’iyya, and warned people to avoid them.
“Approaching the …  zones where the forces are stationed is extremely dangerous,” the spokesperson said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/tsa-video-kristi-noem-shutdown-analysis,Noem’s propaganda video machine turns to airport lines,,,,CNN,"A captive audience of US travelers will be getting a new message from a top US government officials: It’s all Democrats’ fault.
The audience is people in line for Transportation Security Administration screening at US airports. The official is Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
And the fault being alleged is for the government shutdown , which is stretching into its second week.
“It is TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” Noem says in the video. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
The Trump administration, as CNN and others have reported, is well-versed in using the gears of government for propaganda.
Deportation raids are turned into action movie-style social media videos . President Donald Trump’s face adorns government buildings on massive banners . It could also grace a commemorative coin despite a law that prohibits displaying the image of living presidents on coins.
But Noem’s complaint to air travelers feels like something different. Officials aren’t technically supposed to engage in direct politics while on the clock, so Noem’s recording dances up to the line of violating the spirit of that law, the Hatch Act , passed with bipartisan support in 1939 after workers hired by government agencies during the Great Depression were accused of doing campaign work on behalf of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Administration.
It’s called the Hatch Act after Sen. Carl Hatch, the New Mexico Democrat who pushed for it, but the technical name is better: “An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities.”
Much of the law, according to the Congressional Research Service , is focused on federal and state officials taking direct action to influence political campaigns. While Noem’s video is clearly political, it does not have to do specifically with a campaign. She does not mention the next national election, which takes place in November 2026.
The video is on shakier ground when it comes to the law’s prohibition on “engaging in political activity while on duty; on federal property; while wearing a uniform or official insignia; or in a government vehicle.”
Even if Noem’s accusation were a Hatch Act violation, it’s unlikely anybody would do anything about it.
During Trump’s first term, the Office of Special Counsel found that his then-aide Kellyanne Conway repeatedly violated the Hatch Act. Trump obviously disagreed. Conway defied a House subpoena . Nothing ever came of it.
After Trump’s failed 2020 reelection campaign, the Office of Special Counsel found that 11 of his aides had violated the Hatch Act on the campaign trail. Again, nothing came of the finding.
The Office of Special Counsel is supposed to be an independent government agency and it is charged with enforcing the Hatch Act and protecting whistleblowers. But Trump fired the independent head, Hampton Dellinger, shortly after taking office. Dellinger initially challenged his firing, but dropped the challenge in May , citing the long odds of winning at the current Supreme Court.
In Dellinger’s place, Trump nominated Paul Ingrassia, a 30-year-old Trump supporter who was admitted to the bar last summer. Trump frequently shared Ingrassia’s writing online, to the point that Ingrassia has described himself as “ President Trump’s favorite writer ” and, according to a CNN KFile investigation, has shared conspiracy theories about 9/11 and more. More recently, Politico reported on a sexual harassment allegation against Ingrassia that was dropped.
More pertinent, however, is how Ingrassia — should he be confirmed — might view Noem’s actions as DHS secretary under the Hatch Act. Ingrassia’s current job is as White House liaison between the White House and DHS.
The Trump White House would point out that during the Biden administration the Office of Special Counsel, reviewing actions by President Joe Biden’s education secretary , found that referring to the opposition party by name when criticizing an action did not violate the Hatch Act.
The White House also recently compiled a list of actions during the Biden administration that it said were examples of officials wading into politics, including derisive references to Republicans and MAGA Republicans in statements of administration policy and by Biden officials at the White House.
The Trump administration, meanwhile, is going further with its efforts to blame Democrats for the shutdown.
“It’s an objective fact that Democrats are responsible for the government shutdown, the Trump Administration is simply sharing the truth with the American people,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN last week for another story.
That’s not entirely true, since Republicans control all levers of power in Washington at the moment. Democrats are refusing to vote for a spending bill until Republicans agree to extend subsidies for Americans to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges ."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/bondi-benny-johnson-political-violence-arrest,Conservative influencer Benny Johnson accuses Democratic Party of violence as Pam Bondi announces arrest in his death threat,,,,CNN,"A conservative influencer railed against the Democratic Party for having “mainstreamed violence as a political tool” during a Justice Department press conference where Attorney General Pam Bondi discussed a death threat against him.
At the event in Florida, Content creator Benny Johnson said he received a graphic letter threatening the lives of him and his family members — a threat he attributed to Democratic politicians calling for violence against conservatives and Christians.
“We must understand the battle we are fighting, good versus evil, darkness versus light, and good must conquer evil,” Johnson said referring to political violence he attributed to democrats. “Do not make peace with evil.”
Attorney General Pam Bondi, who stood alongside Johnson at the press conference, announced that a George Russell Isbell, Jr., who she says sent the letter to Johnson’s family, has been charged with a federal crime.
The criminal complaint against Isbell Jr. included a photo of the letter prosecutors say he sent to Johnson. The letter refers to Johnson as “ Charlie Kirk Jr.” and accused he and his “fellow WHITE MAGA podcasters” of being racists and pedophiles. The author of the insult-filled letter said that Johnson should be “exterminated” and that they are “hoping the American flag strangles the life out of you.”
“Maybe someone will blow your head off!!! We can hope” the letter says. “Planning any public engagements?”
CNN could not immediately identify a lawyer for Isbell, Jr., who was arrested on Oct. 7 in San Diego.
Bondi used the press conference to decry political violence and highlight crimes committed against Democratic and Republican figures, including Kirk and Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman , who was assassinated in a shooting at her home in June.
Johnson’s comments come as the administration launches a campaign against Antifa , a group it says is an existential threat that wants to violently challenge the federal government and Trump’s supporters.
Last month, Trump designated Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. And in a meeting at the White House Wednesday, he and top administration officials including Bondi vowed to use the full weight of the federal government to bring down Antifa — comparing it to major gangs and drug cartels.
Antifa is more of an ideology than an organized national group, as CNN has previously reported . The name is loosely applied to factions of black-clad leftists or anarchists who show up at protests opposing the police or the government, but has also been used by several on the right, including Trump, as a sort of catch-all reference to any type of left-wing protest activity.
Unlike militant far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, Antifa has never had a leader, nor is there a hierarchy or a command structure.
Bondi called the man arrested for threatening Johnson a “left wing radical,” and vowed to find “any other person” who threatens violence against political figures.
“If anyone is sending a threatening communication through the mail like they did to Benny Johnson, we’re going to find them and we’re going to prosecute them,” she said. “It doesn’t matter what side of the aisle you’re on.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/entertainment/no-doubt-reunion-sphere-las-vegas,No Doubt reuniting again for a limited engagement at Sphere in Las Vegas,,,,CNN,"Don’t speak, just plan on heading to Las Vegas to see No Doubt .
The band fronted by Gwen Stefani will be playing a limited engagement at Sphere in Las Vegas, Nevada. The pop-punk and ska-inspired group most famous for their ’90s-era hits including “Just a Girl” and “Don’t Speak” shared the news on their Instagram on Friday.
The announcement coincides with the 30th anniversary of the release of No Doubt’s seminal sophomore album Tragic Kingdom, which catapulted the foursome to stardom, an accompanying press release detailed. “Their songs – which still dominate radio stations globally – remain as important and culturally influential today as they were when they first hit the airwaves in 1995.”
Stefani expressed her pleasure in a statement.
“The opportunity to create a show at Sphere excites me in a new way. The venue is unique and modern and it opens up a whole new visual palette for us to be creative,” she shared. “Doing it with No Doubt feels like going back in time to relive our history, while also creating something new in a way we never could have imagined.”
“No Doubt Live at Sphere” will be a six-night limited engagement running on May 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, and 16 of next year.
The event marks the band’s first extended run of shows in nearly 14 years, following their Seven Night Stand in Los Angeles in 2012.
They previously reunited for two Coachella weekends last year, and also performed at FireAid in support of relief efforts in the wake of the deadly Los Angles wildfires in January.
Presale sign-up for the shows at Sphere is here and must be completed by October 13. No codes are needed as access is tied to a user’s Ticketmaster account.
Remaining tickets will be available during the general sale starting Friday, October 17 at 1pm ET/10am PT on Ticketmaster."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/sport/basketball-nba-returns-to-china-intl-hnk,"The NBA makes a splash on return to China. Now, it has to stay out of foul trouble",,,,CNN,"As soon as he learned the NBA was returning to China, diehard fan Buke Liu scrambled to get his hands on tickets, paying almost a thousand dollars – a price you might expect for an NBA Finals game – for a ticket to a preseason match-up.
One of America’s most successful sporting exports, the NBA is hugely popular in China, and a rare cultural touchpoint between two nations increasingly seen as geopolitical rivals.
For Liu, and many Chinese fans, it’s been a long wait to go to a game. NBA teams, packed with global stars, have effectively been banned from setting foot in one of basketball’s largest overseas markets since 2019, following a political firestorm that drew the ire of Beijing.
And the pent-up demand has made seats at this weekend’s Phoenix Suns - Brooklyn Nets preseason matches particularly hard to come by.
The Suns beat the Nets 132-127 after overtime in the first game on Friday at The Venetian Hotel in Macao, the glitzy gambling hub in southern China known for its casino-powered entertainment.
The second contest is slated for Sunday at the end of a three-day basketball carnival that also allows fans to try out their hoop skills at game booths, as well as meeting some of the league’s iconic former players, from Shaquille O’Neal and Yao Ming to Vince Carter and Jeremy Lin.
Liu forked out $980 to a scalper for his seat at the Sunday game and access to fan activities. Tickets to see the same teams face each other in Phoenix for the Suns’ home game in January are on sale for as little as $15, but the university student has no regrets about paying top dollar for his tickets.
“It’s worth it. They are playing in China,” the Suns fan told CNN. “I am very happy about the return of the NBA China games because it allows (Chinese) fans … to watch the games in person.”
The return, after a six-year absence, packs more than just fanfare: it bears symbolic significance. In 2019, a social media post from then Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong protesters angered Beijing, culminating in televised games being pulled and sponsors in China severing ties with the league.
While NBA games have gradually returned to state-owned television and commercial activities have slowly trickled back over the years, Chinese fans being able to see players in person once again marks the culmination of the comeback.
Ticketing revenue, merchandise sales and sponsorship opportunities, backed by a massive fanbase which spends big without batting an eyelid, are what the NBA stands to gain from its return to the country, where basketball is booming among its population of 1.4 billion, experts and insiders tell CNN.
But greater opportunities also come with greater risks, Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, told CNN, cautioning that the NBA will now have to tread carefully to avoid the tiniest misstep.
“It’s a thaw, but it’s also a test of how far the NBA and Chinese authorities are willing to rebuild ties,” he said.
Tapping into the vastly lucrative Chinese market and playing by Beijing’s rules can be a perilous tightrope for international brands, like the NBA – especially when it comes to issues that clash with their corporate values.
“One misstep by a player or a coach, (an) offhand remark like the one Daryl (Morey) made, could reignite those tensions,” said Argenti.
Geopolitics, though, were the last thing on the minds of Liu and other fans that headed to the NBA spectacle on Friday – they’re just happy to see elite basketball back, even a preseason contest, back on the court in China.
Devin Booker appeared to steal the show as many fans turned up in his jersey cheering for the Suns star guard whenever he hit a jumper.
Among them were father Arkers Wong and his 12-year-old son Altus, who brought along a tiny basketball autographed by Booker during a previous trip to Phoenix to watch the four-time NBA All-Star.
“We were so excited…Almost all the players had their time on the court,” said Wong, who spent about $6,400 for the three-day experience, that includes stays at hotels.
“We were sitting next to the players’ entrance [to the court] so some of them signed the jerseys we brought,” he added.
Student Joseph Hu, also a Booker fan, is already planning ahead.
“Of course, I will see them again if they come back to play next year,” he told CNN.
Home fans also showered Zeng Fanbo with thunderous applause when the Chinese forward made his debut with the Nets during Friday’s preseason game. Zeng has signed a one-year Exhibit 10 – a one-year, minimum salary agreement that isn’t guaranteed – contract with Brooklyn.
The Chinese market has plenty to offer, especially at a time when the league is exploring opportunities beyond the fanbase back home. The NBA’s TV ratings in the US have declined slightly over recent years – though, according to the league, Game 7 of the 2025 Finals series recorded the biggest TV audience for a single Finals game in six years.
David Carter, adjunct professor at USC Marshall School of Business, told CNN that the global market can be “vital” for growing revenue.
“Any concentrated focus on China, one that is successfully positioned and rolled out, should enable the NBA to drive this revenue and franchise value growth,” he said.
The NBA’s popularity in China exploded after Yao Ming was drafted by the Houston Rockets as the No. 1 pick in 2002. Before the 2019 fallout, nearly 500 million people, more than a third of China’s population, were tuning in to watch the league’s content, according to an estimate by Chinese social media giant Tencent, which currently holds the league’s digital broadcasting rights.
In 2019, NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum told Reuters an estimated 300 million people in China played the sport. That number has likely climbed since then, with viral videos on Chinese social media showing how the love for the sport has spread to rural areas, sparking huge rivalries in village tournaments. The game has also inspired the popular reality show Dunk of China, which featured former NBA players Jeremy Lin and Stephon Marbury coaching skilled amateur players.
The value of NBA China, the arm of the league that manages all its operations in the Greater China region, is estimated at approximately $5 billion, according to an analysis commissioned by ESPN in 2022.
“China is the NBA’s most important market outside of the United States, with hundreds of millions of fans, huge media rights sponsorship potential,” said Dartmouth professor Argenti. “Walking away is never going to be a long-term option.”
Some of the biggest names in the NBA have already taken steps before the league to reconnect with their Chinese fans in person. LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Nikola Jokić toured China to promote sneakers earlier this year.
NBA players are also popping up on a range of Chinese social media platforms – from the X-like Weibo to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok – to share snippets of their lives and maximize their exposure to Chinese fans.
Matthew Spalter, chief operating officer at East Goes Global, an agency that specializes in helping localize social media content for a Chinese audience, said his company has been helping at least 10 NBA players and one third of all teams to formulate marketing strategies to break into the Chinese market.
“We’ve never seen the demand higher than we’ve seen since really diving into sports,” Spalter said. “It’s like an open pool of opportunity.”
Former Phoenix Suns forward Shawn Marion, who was invited to Macau to meet fans, told CNN that his visit reminded him how much the nation loves the NBA. “I just love coming here,” he said.
Before the relationship turned sour, the NBA was warmly welcomed in China, where it regularly staged games. But it took just one comment to jeopardize the seemingly friendly dynamic.
Andrew Spalter, CEO at East Goes Global, says his company prepares clients for sensitive questions that come their way.
“We simply ask them high-level questions,” he said, adding that they would advise clients not to talk about things they would normally avoid in public.
But the reality is more nuanced.
Argenti said the NBA’s comeback is a masterclass in how to navigate the Chinese market amid intensifying geopolitical tensions.
But he warns that things could get more complicated again in President Donald Trump’s second term.
“They’ve (got) trouble at home and trouble abroad because, if they get it wrong, Trump will amplify it, make it worse than it already is,” said Argenti. “That makes it even more of a tightrope.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/business/cpi-inflation-data-government-shutdown,"With Social Security’s COLA on the line, the Trump administration plans to release inflation data delayed by the shutdown",,,,CNN,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics is calling some staff back to work to prepare its closely watched inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, despite the government shutdown, a Trump administration official told CNN.
The CPI report, postponed from October 15 to October 24 due to the shutdown, will be released just in time to meet the deadline for adjusting Social Security payments for next year.
“This release allows the Social Security Administration to meet statutory deadlines to ensure the accurate and timely payment of benefits,” the BLS said in a statement on its website Friday, adding that no other releases will be rescheduled or produced until the government reopens.
The BLS has stopped all operations since October 1, when the government’s funding lapsed. Only one employee was assigned to continue working full-time at the bureau throughout the shutdown, according to contingency plans released by the US Department of Labor, which oversees the bureau. This meant that data collection and analysis were effectively halted.
However, a Trump official told CNN that without September’s CPI data, the annual increase to Social Security benefits, which takes effect in January, could be impacted. (Social Security benefits continue to be distributed during the shutdown.)
As a result, more staff will be called back into work on an as-needed basis to complete the September CPI report.
Last week, the BLS did not release  its monthly jobs report, which usually comes out on the first Friday of every month.
Beneficiaries receive an annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) to help them keep up with inflation. It’s based on an inflation metric from the third quarter of the year, which includes September. Social Security typically unveils the COLA amount shortly after BLS announces the CPI for September.
In its shutdown contingency plan, the Labor Department noted that a delay in the CPI release in October could impact the COLA announcement.
Senior citizens, people with disabilities and others received a 2.5% adjustment for this year, which was lower than the previous two years after a steady decline in inflation in 2024. More than 74 million people receive monthly Social Security payments.
The Social Security Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when it would release the 2026 COLA.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/covid-vaccine-returning-troops,Pentagon orders ‘white glove’ treatment for those returning to military service after Covid-19 vaccine refusal,,,,CNN,"Former troops kicked out of military service for refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine will receive “special category VIP or ‘white glove’ treatment” if they rejoin, the Pentagon said Thursday in conjunction with the release of a memo to military service leaders. The changes follow criticism from some social media influencers about how returning troops have been treated at military intake facilities.
Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement the changes would accompany a review of the Pentagon’s Covid-19 vaccine policy that would examine “what occurred, why, and what the Department will do to ensure that it never happens again.”
The memo, signed by Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Anthony Tata, told military service leaders to make changes at Military Entrance Processing Stations, or MEPS, sites where recruits undergo medical screenings, aptitude tests and other final checks before being brought into military service.
“As these efforts continue, the Military Departments are directed to prioritize special-category VIP treatment for affected former service members,” Tata wrote.
Special treatment for returning troops includes accepting late arrival, being given priority processing, and a “trained escort to expedite screening,” the memo said.
The reinstatement of troops kicked out over the vaccine mandate has been a priority for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, though only a fraction of those who were separated have put back on a military uniform. As of May this year, only 13 people of more than 8,000 removed from service had returned under the Pentagon’s policy to reinstate them. Asked Friday for updated numbers a Pentagon spokesperson said the agency had no update to those figures.
The memo comes just weeks after a closed-door meeting between Tata, Hegseth and other senior officials with a group of people who have been outspoken on social media about the Covid-19 vaccine mandate.
The Pentagon started requiring that troops be vaccinated against Covid-19 in 2021, one of many vaccines required by the military for its service members, particularly those deploying abroad. The mandate was rescinded in 2023 after Congress required its removal, an effort largely seen as a win for conservative lawmakers and advocates who argued it was hindering the military’s recruitment efforts, though Pentagon officials said there was no evidence to support the claim.
Tata also wrote in the memo that the department would undertake a review of its vaccine policies that will include looking at the consistency of the Covid-19 vaccine mandate “with historical vaccine policy,” personnel impacts, how the mandate was managed across the military services, how it was decided which individuals were exempt from the mandate and how people were discharged.
Many of the changes for reentering troops directed in the latest memo appear to address concerns about the arduous intake processes at military facilities. Those facilities have long been understaffed and plagued by lengthy timelines bringing in new recruits.
Tata said in the memo that the Pentagon has “implemented enhancements” intended “to ensure a professional, respectful, and efficient experience.”
The memo appeared to take some involved in the MEPS process by surprise, with one source familiar with MEPS telling CNN, “MEPS staffing nationwide is horrendous, there are no trained escorts.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/science/bearded-vulture-nest-medieval-13th-century-sandal,"A medieval sandal, other cultural artifacts found in bearded vulture nests",,,,CNN,"The bearded vulture , a large bird of prey with an unusual diet consisting primarily of bones, has long fascinated ornithologists. But now, a new study has shown why the bone-eating birds could be even more intriguing than once thought. Their carefully crafted nests, serving multiple generations, may also act as “ natural museums ,” preserving centuries-old cultural artifacts, according to scientists.
In Spain, researchers studied a dozen bearded vulture nests between 2008 and 2014. The team analyzed them layer by layer, uncovering over 200 human-made objects that the birds may have repurposed as building materials. Carbon dating of these items revealed that the nests date back to at least the 13th century, with the oldest artifact being a sandal that’s over 700 years old. The findings were published September 11 in the journal Ecology .
“We knew that the bearded vulture is a transporting species that can carry objects to its nest for construction, but we were surprised by the number of objects found and their age,” said lead author Antoni Margalida, an ecologist at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology at the Spanish National Research Council in Jaca, Spain. “This means that these sites, used for centuries, are quality locations that different generations have used for breeding.”
Not only does the research open new avenues for finding cultural artifacts, but it could also help future conservation efforts for the species, the scientists said.
The bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate to specialize in eating bones, comprising up to 90% of the creature’s diet . As the study authors set out to find historical nests — sites no longer in use either due to local extinction or unsuitable habitat factors — they were primarily interested in finding bone remains. The team aimed to study the past inhabitants’ diet and compare it with the diet of modern birds today.
But the researchers said stumbling upon the copious number of artifacts entangled in the historical nests took them by surprise. Over 9% of the specimens pulled from the structures were human-made.
Besides the sandal, which was crafted from woven twigs and grasses, other items found within the nests included a painted piece of medieval leather that resembles a mask, remnants of a basket dated to the 18th century, an arrow from a crossbow, ropes and rigging for horses, and more. The sandal is the oldest artifact so far, but the study team has yet to carbon-date other items, Margalida said.
The documented findings offer an intriguing look into human culture, according to Margalida. “This can give us information about how people dressed, how they hunted (through the slingshots and crossbows found), and which domestic and wild species were most abundant in the ecosystem,” he said.
A blue jay and a green jay mated, researchers say. Their offspring is a scientific marvel
Because bearded vultures, which have a nearly 10-foot (3-meter) wingspan, like to nest in cliff caves or rocky areas that have stable temperatures and humidity, bone remains, human-made objects and other nest materials can stay relatively well-preserved, according to the research.
“This study sheds new light, and really a whole new angle on the place of the Bearded Vulture in our understanding of the interplay between a fascinating bird and the history of human culture,” John Fitzpatrick, director emeritus for the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, said in an email.
“The fact that Bearded Vultures are now recognized as ‘recording artists’ documenting human history just adds to their unique mystique,” he added. Fitzpatrick, who is also professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University, was not involved with the new research.
In southern Spain, where the researchers recovered the nests, bearded vultures have been locally extinct for 70 to 130 years, according to the study. To find the nest sites, the study authors spent years looking into historical records as well as speaking with older residents of the area who remember the birds when they were around. Today, bearded vultures can still be found in areas of Europe, Asia and Africa, but they are less common and widespread than they once were centuries ago.

“While this research occurred in Spain, the Bearded Vulture has a broad distribution over the Old World — including in the Himalayas, the Caucasus, and the Ethiopian highlands,” said Evan Buechley, a researcher on raptor ecology and vice president of conservation for international programs with The Peregrine Fund, a nonprofit that aims to conserve birds of prey worldwide.
Studying other nests, such as those in Ethiopia or Tibet, “could reveal fascinating insights into the human histories of other mountainous regions of the world,” he added in an email. Buechley was also not involved with the study.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List categorized the bearded vulture in 2014 as near threatened . By studying the birds’ nests, including those that are no longer in use, researchers can better understand factors that make habitats suitable, such as the basis of their diet or the effects of pesticides in the area, Margalida said.
In addition, understanding the species’ historical factors, such as their breeding distribution and diet, could help researchers decide where and how to reintroduce the species in future projects, Buechley said.
The research also highlights the large effect humans have on wildlife. Buechley pointed to the California condor . This New World vulture is a critically endangered species that faces issues with its chicks ingesting trash brought back to the nests by their parents.

“This underscores the importance of maintaining vast areas of wild habitat that remain largely free of some of the worst toxins that humans create and leave around the landscape for curious critters — even as big and rock-solid as Bearded Vultures — to play with and take home,” Fitzpatrick said.
“Bearded Vulture is already a revered bird bearing a special place in the hearts and minds of people who know about it,” he added. “Anything that informs the public about the fascinating ways in which wild birds and human culture intersect has huge value, both for our own appreciation of the extraordinary world around us and for our commitment to ensure the long-term protection of wild species and wild places.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-comey-trump-enemies-prosecutions,Could Trump’s prosecutions of foes like James Comey and Letitia James backfire?,,,,CNN,"In one way, it’s a rather frightening precedent for a president to so clearly and directly force the prosecutions of his political foes, as Donald Trump has now done with both former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
(Try as Trump’s allies might, there is no comparing his role in these prosecutions with Joe Biden’s relationship to Trump’s indictments. It’s a far more direct line.)
But in another way, it will at least be instructive.
After spending years trying to force legal peril on his foes and being thwarted by aides who apparently thought better of it, Trump is finally going to be forced to pony up with actual evidence. And he will have to pony up in a forum that has been far less favorable to his claims than the political arena: courts of law.
Indeed, it seems quite possible these prosecutions will fail. And predictably so, given that appears to have been the overwhelming conclusion of the more experienced prosecutors who first looked at these cases.
But what would that mean?
This could actually backfire on Trump by laying bare the nakedness and politicization of these prosecutions. That’s because Americans are already inclined to think that’s what Trump is doing — much more so than they thought Biden did.
Conversely, Trump seems more preoccupied with vengeance than convictions, with firing up his base and with giving his opponents headaches — which these cases will certainly provide for Comey and James. And at the very least, these efforts send a message to Trump’s would-be antagonists to back off.
Let’s run through it.
First, it’s worth recapping the evidence that these prosecutions aren’t exactly on the firmest of terrains.
In both cases, a batch of reporting — including from CNN — has made clear that a number of prosecutors didn’t believe the prosecutions would succeed, for either Comey or James .
Career prosecutors didn’t sign the indictments. CNN has also reported even Trump’s loyalist attorney general, Pam Bondi, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche have had concerns about the cases. And Trump of course had to force out a US attorney he had nominated who resisted these cases, Erik Siebert.
The best Trump could apparently find to charge ahead was a loyalist who was an insurance lawyer by trade with very little experience in federal courtrooms, Lindsey Halligan. CNN reported Friday that Halligan didn’t coordinate with top DOJ leaders like Bondi and Blanche in the James case. And she will now face off in the Comey case with renowned former US attorney Patrick Fitzgerald .
While grand juries agreed to indict in both cases, that’s generally a very low bar to clear. The standard of evidence is much lower. And federal grand juries declined to indict in just 11 of more than 160,000 cases during a one-year period between 2009 and 2010, according to a Washington Post study.
We also know that the Comey prosecution struggled to clear even that very low bar. One charge against him was declined — again, an extremely rare occurrence — while the others got 14 votes, slightly more than the 12 required.
There are also open questions about whether the cases will even proceed. Both James and Comey seem to have colorable arguments to get these cases dismissed on vindictive prosecution grounds , given Trump’s clear role in forcing them. (Comey’s defense is already pursuing this .) And they could also ask for dismissals by arguing that Halligan was illegitimately appointed .
As for the details of the actual cases? We know very little about them in James’s case. That’s because the charges actually relate to a real estate transaction that’s different from the ones the administration has previously flagged as being potentially fraudulent. But in Comey’s case, even conservative legal analysts have been quite skeptical of the charge that he made false statements to Congress.
All of which reinforces that getting 12 jurors to unanimously vote that Comey and James are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt could be quite difficult.
And if that happens, it would actually be a little more familiar than people might realize.
While the cases weren’t as high-profile, we have seen prosecutions apparently stemming from Trump’s political vendettas. And they haven’t gone well .
Special counsel John Durham lost two of three cases in his Trump-spurred investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. And former Trump administration US attorney Geoffrey Berman has indicated charges were brought in 2018 against Democratic lawyer Geoffrey Craig after political pressure was applied (Berman said a Trump political appointee told him to “even things out” after prosecutions of Trump allies). Craig was quickly acquitted.
Failures in these new cases, though, would be much bigger deals. And if they do fail, it would be a marked contrast to the overwhelmingly successful prosecutions of Trump and his allies . When those cases went to trial, they almost always succeeded.
That would reinforce that the difference between those prosecutions and the new Trump-forced ones isn’t just Trump’s much more prominent role in them; it would also be that Trump is forcing much thinner cases.
And that’s actually a political risk for him.
Despite all the right’s attempts to equate what Trump is doing with what Biden did and argue that Biden started it, Americans actually seem to understand there is a difference.
A Pew Research Center poll taken in late September showed 62% of Americans overall and even 40% of Republican-leaning voters think Trump has improperly pushed for investigations of his political foes. That number for GOP-leaning voters is particularly striking.
After Trump was indicted, by contrast, polls showed less than half of Americans connected the charges to Biden and politics.
And generally speaking, majorities said the charges against Trump were justified and even that he should have been convicted (which he was in the only case that went to trial, in New York).
All of that said, it’s not even clear that Trump cares that these cases might fail. He’s certainly been warned enough of that possibility, and he’s pressed forward anyway.
All of which suggests he might view it as worth it regardless.
Even if the cases ultimately fail, he will have created problems for these foes, forcing them into complex and costly legal defenses of themselves. And these aren’t just critics; they’re people who played major roles in legally scrutinizing Trump.
The message sent: You come at Trump, and we will make life difficult for you. At the very least, Trump has ratcheted up the legal lawfare battle in ways that could give future would-be antagonists pause. Trump has taken a similar approach to creating legal problems for media institutions, law firms and colleges.
It’s also quite likely that Trump would use even dismissals or acquittals to ratchet up his claims of deep-state and judicial persecution. Both cases happen to have been randomly assigned to Biden-appointed judges, a perhaps-unfortunate circumstance for our body politic.
Trump has shown he’s quite happy to attack judges who rule against his side and use their rulings to chip away at the legitimacy of perhaps his biggest remaining obstacle to power: the judiciary.
Trump’s supposed judicial persecution is an argument that has largely only been embraced by Trump supporters, not the public writ large. But the fact that his supporters have embraced it is significant.
And it means even adverse outcomes for Trump could turn his frightening precedent into a frightening scenario for our country."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/janet-mills-susan-collins-us-senate-maine,Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to challenge Susan Collins for US Senate seat,,,,CNN,"Maine Gov. Janet Mills is expected to announce her bid for US Senate on Tuesday, becoming the most high-profile Democrat to date to enter the race to challenge GOP Sen. Susan Collins, according to a source familiar with the plans.
The announcement date, the source cautioned, could shift due to the ongoing government shutdown.
Mills, a two-term governor and former attorney general, is a major recruit for Democrats looking for a seasoned opponent to take on the five-term incumbent. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke with her earlier this year about running.
But Mills is joining a crowded field of political novices , some of whom have vowed to stay in the race whether she ran or not. The Democratic primary will test how strongly voters in the state value experience over generational change.
Mills’ top opponents – oysterman Graham Platner, brewery owner Dan Kleban and former US House staffer Jordan Wood – have never held political office but argue they understand the affordability challenges facing Maine voters better than Collins, the 72-year-old incumbent.
Mills, 77, would be the oldest freshman senator in US history if she won, but also has a proven record of winning statewide.
And at a time when Democrats are also looking for fighters to stand up to President Donald Trump, Mills has shown a willingness to push back on the administration. During a meeting between the president and governors earlier this year, Mills sparred with Trump over transgender athletes and federal funding.
What we know about the dispute over transgender athletes between Maine’s governor and the Trump administration
Any chance Democrats have of winning back the Senate or narrowing Republicans’ three-seat majority likely runs through Maine. Collins is the only Republican senator up for reelection next year in a state then-Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024.
Democrats acknowledge that Collins, who was first elected to the Senate in 1996, will be difficult to beat. In 2020, Democrats saw an opportunity to oust her by capitalizing on anger over her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Millions were poured into a fund to back an eventual Collins’ challenger, and Democrats avoided a messy primary by rallying around former Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon.
Collins was reelected by nearly nine points even as President Joe Biden won the state by a similar margin.
Democrats have notched prominent recruits in North Carolina, where former two-term Gov. Roy Cooper will run for an open seat. And in Ohio, former Sen. Sherrod Brown is running against Sen. Jon Husted, who was appointed earlier this year to the seat formerly held by Vice President JD Vance."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/lindsey-halligan-no-coordinate-letitia-james-indictment-doj,Lindsey Halligan didn’t coordinate NY AG Letitia James indictment with Pam Bondi’s DOJ,,,,CNN,"Attorney General Pam Bondi was caught off guard Thursday when President Donald Trump’s handpicked US attorney, Lindsey Halligan, secured New York Attorney General Letitia James ’ indictment from a grand jury, two sources familiar with what happened told CNN.
Halligan, who has been running the Eastern District of Virginia for just over two weeks, did not coordinate with Bondi or other leaders at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, DC, or inform them about timing before presenting the case to a grand jury.
A grand jury on Thursday indicted James on two charges — bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution — as the Justice Department continues to pursue charges against Trump’s political opponents.
Trump never forgets: Bombshell indictments open a new phase in a retribution presidency
CNN previously reported that Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche viewed the case against James as weak, reflecting the advice from the former US Attorney Erik Siebert and career lawyers in the Eastern District of Virginia.
Halligan had told some people, including at least one Justice Department official, in recent days that she was planning to move forward with the charges against James. She presented the case alone in front of the grand jury on Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia.
Halligan had originally planned on bringing the case to a grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia, in part because there was a belief that the grand jury there would be more supportive. The case will be heard, however, in Norfolk.
Justice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin told CNN: “As a matter of law, we will not discuss any grand jury matters with the media, but this Justice Department is united as one team in our mission to make America safe again and the attorney general, deputy attorney general, along with the entire team at Main Justice continue to empower our US attorneys to pursue justice in every case.”
CNN has reached out to the Eastern District of Virginia offices for comment.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/travel/secret-tunnel-colosseum-rome-commodus-passage,A secret tunnel once used by emperors is opening beneath the Colosseum,,,,CNN,"A 2,000-year-old tunnel once used by Roman emperors to slip into the Colosseum unseen will open to the public this month, offering visitors a rare glimpse of the arena’s imperial backstage.
Known as the Passage of Commodus, the 180-foot corridor was built beneath the amphitheater to let emperors and VIP guests reach their seats in the imperial box without mingling with the crowds.
The passage takes its name from Emperor Commodus, the ruthless leader who governed from 177 to 192 CE and was nearly assassinated in the underground walkway.
Moviegoers will remember Commodus as Joaquin Phoenix’s scheming emperor in “Gladiator” — the one who murdered his father, Marcus Aurelius, and faced Russell Crowe’s Maximus in the arena.
In real life, Commodus’ vanity went further. He fought in gladiatorial bouts dressed as Hercules, killing weakened fighters and even animals — once beheading an ostrich before a cheering crowd, according to the Colosseum Archaeological Park.
The hidden corridor was first uncovered between 1810 and 1814 by French excavators under architect Carlo Lucangeli, then reopened in 1874 and studied again in the 1990s. During the 2020–2021 restoration of the entire site, archaeologists fully mapped the tunnel and began a new phase of conservation.
The recent restoration removed centuries of dust and grime, reattached fragile plaster using laser tools, and revealed marble-lined walls etched with landscapes and mythological scenes — including the story of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry. Near the entrance, carvings of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobats recall the spectacle that once filled the arena.
“Once this passage is now open to the public, visitors will appreciate what it was like to be an emperor,” said archaeologist Barbara Nazzaro, who led the work.
Massimo Osanna, director general of Italy’s museums, called the reopening “a significant milestone” that blends research and preservation. New features such as a tactile map and video reconstructions aim to make the site “truly accessible and inclusive for all audiences.”
The vaulted passage, added in the first and second centuries after the Colosseum’s initial construction, consists of three branches: two running east–west and one north–south.
A secret tunnel city hidden under Rome’s ancient heart is being revealed
The restoration includes lighting that recreates daylight from long-sealed skylights, plus glass panels allowing visitors to watch archaeologists at work. A new excavation set for next year will trace the tunnel’s route — possibly toward the gladiators’ barracks.
The project was funded by the Colosseum Archaeological Park and Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR)."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina,Measles outbreaks across the US continue to add to record case count,,,,CNN,"A deadly measles outbreak in Texas ended in August , but outbreaks in other parts of the United States continue to add hundreds of new measles cases to this year’s record national total.
There have been an average of 27 new measles cases reported each week since the end of August, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual total – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago.
There’s a new outbreak in Ohio, a recent surge in cases in Minnesota and more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren in South Carolina are in quarantine because of an ongoing outbreak there.
Before this year, the US had recorded only 10 large measles outbreaks – defined by the CDC as more than 50 related cases – since reaching elimination status in 2000. But an ongoing outbreak along the border between Arizona and Utah is already the third large outbreak this year.
There have been more than 90 confirmed cases related to the outbreak – at least 59 in Arizona and 36 in Utah, according to state health departments – and case counts continue to grow.
Tracking measles cases in the United States
Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist in Utah, said there is still a lot of opportunity for measles to continue to spread in the area.
“Unfortunately, I think we still have quite a while to go with infections. We know that most of our infections have been localized down towards the southern end of our state, but I think we are starting to see now people get infected even at the very north end of our state,” she said. “So I do think that this is going to continue to bop around and spread in different communities. I suspect we’re in the middle of it.”
Experts say that any amount of measles spread is cause for concern, and large outbreaks highlight the dangers of declining vaccination rates.
“When you have multiple cases happening, particularly with those numbers, it’s only possible because you have susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
There are measles cases in the US every year, often introduced via international travel, Harris said. But those cases can really multiply only if they’re happening among other people who are unvaccinated – and can multiply at large scale only if large parts of a community are unvaccinated. The Texas outbreak is evidence of this, he said, with state health department data showing that 97% of its cases were among people who had not gotten one or both of the recommended two vaccine doses.
“The story here is: Parents of young children are skeptical about vaccination,” Harris said. “There are lots of reasons why, but if that weren’t the case, this wouldn’t be a story, because we wouldn’t have these outbreaks.”
A record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination in the last school year, and coverage for all reported vaccines – including the measles vaccine – continued on a downward trend, according to the CDC .
Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped to 92.5%, the latest data shows. Because measles is such a highly contagious disease, public health experts say that at least 95% MMR coverage is needed to prevent spread. Last year marks the fifth year in a row that coverage has been below that target.
In Utah, Nolen says that public health officials have a good grasp on where measles is spreading thanks to wastewater monitoring that can capture virus levels beyond official case counts, and where the risk is elevated due to low vaccination rates.
“In those areas, we try to work with the local health department and the community to get the word out that we know that there is measles in their area and that we really encourage families to consider getting vaccines,” she said. Misinformation has created some vaccine hesitancy, she said, but vaccination rates have ticked up as awareness about the current outbreak has grown.
Acting CDC director, citing Trump directive, calls for MMR shot to be split into three despite no evidence of benefit
A separate ongoing outbreak in South Carolina also threatens to grow quickly.
More than 150 unvaccinated children are in quarantine after measles exposures at two schools in the northern part of the state, one public elementary school and one public charter school in Spartanburg County.
“Those schools are following the protocols to exclude these students until the period of potential disease transmission has safely ended,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Thursday. “Those students are identified as having been exposed and not having been vaccinated, and that’s the reason for the exclusion.”
About 90% of people who have been exposed to measles and do not have immune protection from vaccination could get infected, Bell said, and “worst-case scenario” would be that rate of infection among the at-risk students who are being closely monitored for symptoms while in quarantine.
There have been 11 confirmed measles cases in South Carolina this year, including seven associated with the Spartanburg County outbreak since September 25, according to the state health department .
Spartanburg County has one of the lowest school vaccination rates in the state, according to data from the state health department. Last school year, less than 90% of school students there received their required immunizations, which includes two doses of the MMR vaccine. School vaccination coverage has been falling in Spartanburg County for years, as it has across the state and nationwide.
A measles case reported Thursday in Greenville County, South Carolina’s most populous county, is being investigated for a possible link to the Spartanburg outbreak. But the state health department is not aware of any other potentially related cases in other states or jurisdictions, Bell said Thursday.
It’s “incredibly expensive and demanding” for local health departments to respond to measles threats, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The organization has worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
“Health departments are already stretched thin by budget constraints and staff attrition. Adding measles outbreaks to their workload is draining the reserves of even the best-resourced departments,” Rivers said. “It’s been hard to understand from the outside what supports the federal government is offering to local responders.”
Trust in federal health leadership is failing under RFK Jr., new poll finds
The CDC has continued to update its measles tracker during the federal government shutdown, even as other surveillance data systems have come to a halt. And local health leaders say they have continued to stay in contact with CDC experts, although they have been warned that response times may be a bit slower.
“Due to a lapse in federal funding, CDC has developed an orderly shutdown plan, ensuring critical public health and safety functions continue without interruption. As found in the plan, CDC and [the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] would collect data being reported by states, hospitals, and others, and report out critical information needed for state and local health authorities and providers to track, prevent and treat diseases,” according to a statement from the CDC.
But federal surveillance systems are far from perfect, and experts say that formally reported measles cases in the US are probably a significant undercount, with some estimating that this year’s total could be closer to 5,000 cases.
Current measles outbreak trends are “consistent with an undervaccinated population,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has exacerbated problems with both disease surveillance and vaccination rates, he said, by cutting federal health agency workers and failing to fully endorse the MMR vaccine. Instead, as the measles outbreak in Texas spread earlier this year, Kennedy touted unconventional therapies for treatment and said that getting vaccinated is a personal choice.
“We’re in the midst of a measles epidemic,” Offit said. “We should have an administration that stands up clearly and definitively and holds press conferences saying, ‘Vaccinate your children. These are preventable illnesses.’ ”
In a statement to CNN, HHS said that “Secretary Kennedy has been outspoken in his support for the measles vaccine and has encouraged both national and state-level action to address and prevent outbreaks.”
Trust in federal health leadership has suffered under Kennedy, a new poll shows , with most US adults saying they disapprove of the way he’s handled vaccine policy and his role as health secretary overall."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/middleeast/hostages-gaza-israel-hamas-ceasefire-intl,Who are the hostages still held in Gaza?,,,,CNN,"All the hostages still held in Gaza are set to be released as soon as Monday under the first phase of a ceasefire plan agreed by Hamas and Israel, US President Donald Trump said late on Wednesday.
More than two years after Hamas and its allies kidnapped 251 people from Israel and took them to Gaza, 47 hostages remain in the enclave, with at least 20 believed to be alive. The remains of another hostage, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Hadar Goldin, have been held there since 2014, when he was killed and his body taken to the strip.
The Israeli government has said 26 of the 48 hostages are deceased, although the status of two others – Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi – remains uncertain. The government previously expressed “grave concern” over their fates.
The hostages who are believed to be alive are all men and all but one are in their 20s and 30s. Women, children and men over the age of 50 were released under previous ceasefire agreements.
One woman, Inbar Hayman, is among the 26 in Gaza who have been declared dead.
Of those still believed to be living or whose status is unknown, 11 were taken from the Nova music festival. Eight were kidnapped from several kibbutzim, or small communities, in southern Israel. Three are Israeli soldiers – two were kidnapped from military bases and one from a tank.
Here is what we know about them.
Twin brothers Ziv and Gali Berman were kidnapped from their home in kibbutz Kfar-Aza during the October 7 terror attack. They were 26 at the time. Speaking to CNN in February, their mother Liran Berman said other hostages who had been released had told the family the brothers were alive and separated from each other.
Several of the hostages were kidnapped alongside friends and family members, some of whom have since returned home.
Brothers Ariel and David Cunio were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz, alongside Ariel’s partner Yehoud, David’s wife Sharon, and their three-year-old twin daughters, Yuli and Emma. Sharon, Yuli and Emma were released under a ceasefire agreement in November 2023, while Yehoud was freed earlier this year.
Eitan Horn was visiting his brother Iair when they were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz. Iair was released earlier this year. A propaganda video showing him saying goodbye to Eitan was released by Hamas in March. The Horn family said that seeing him in the video “broke their hearts.”
“Since Iair returned to us, he hasn’t stopped thinking about and working for Eitan and all the other hostages he met in captivity who are still there,” the family said in a statement.
Matan Zangauker and his partner Illana Gritzewsky were kidnapped from the same kibbutz as the Horn brothers. Gritzewsky, a Mexican national, was released on November 30, 2023, as part of a short-lived hostage-and-ceasefire deal, while Zangauker was left behind.
Omri Miran, then 46, was kidnapped when Hamas gunmen broke into his family’s home in kibbutz Nahal Oz. In April 2024, Hamas put out a video showing Miran, alongside American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who has since been released.
Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David are childhood best friends who were kidnapped together from the Nova Music Festival. In February 2025, Hamas filmed Gilboa-Dalal and David watching other hostages being released, posting the video to Telegram.
Gilboa-Dalal’s brother Gal told CNN this amounted to psychological torment. “To make them see what freedom might look like for them and then close the door and drag them back to hell – it’s awful,” he said.
Avinatan Or was also kidnapped from the Nova festival alongside his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was rescued in an IDF operation in central Gaza in June 2024. She revealed that they had been separated during the abduction.
Alon Ohel , Yosef-Chaim Ohana , Elkana Bohbot , Segev Kalfon , Maxim Herkin , Eitan Abraham Mor , Bar Kupershtein and Rom Braslavski were also kidnapped from the Nova festival.
Ohel, Ohana, Bohbot, Braslavski and Mor were all seen helping wounded victims at the site before their abduction.
The IDF soldiers Nimrod Cohen , Matan Angrest and Tamir Nimrodi are among the youngest still held in Gaza.
Cohen appeared in a Hamas propaganda video posted online on March 1 this year. His family was able to identify him thanks to a tattoo on his arm, his mother Vicky Cohen told CNN. “We recognized Nimrod because of that tattoo. Otherwise, I wouldn’t recognize him because you couldn’t hear his voice or see his face,” she told CNN.
Bipin Joshi , a Nepali student, was working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped. His family said earlier this week that a previously unseen video showing him alive in captivity was recently recovered by the Israeli military in Gaza.
The video is believed to have been filmed in November 2023, just weeks after Joshi’s kidnapping. In a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the family said the video had given them “unwavering faith” that Joshi is alive.
Israeli officials had previously said there were “grave concerns” for Joshi.
Besides Joshi, three other foreign nationals are still held in Gaza, two of them from Thailand and one from Tanzania.
All three – Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Sudthisak Rinthalak, from Thailand, and Joshua Mollel, from Tanzania – have been declared dead by the Israeli government.
The bodies of the 26 hostages who have been declared dead by the government are also set to be returned as part of the agreement announced on Wednesday.
However, three Israeli sources told CNN that Hamas may not know the location of, or may be unable to retrieve, the remains of some of them. According to one source, that is thought to be the case for between seven and nine of the deceased hostages, while another source put the figure at between 10 and 15.
Inbar Hayman was kidnapped from the Nova festival. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum announced in December 2023 that she had been killed by Hamas while in captivity. She remains the only female hostage still in Gaza.
At least 13 of the deceased hostages whose remains are still in Gaza were killed during the terror attacks on October 7, 2023 and their bodies then taken to the enclave.
They include several Israeli soldiers, including two who were dual US and Israeli citizens – Omer Maxim Neutra from Long Island, New York, and Itay Chen .

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/economy/us-consumer-sentiment,Americans aren’t worried about the government shutdown. But they remain unnerved about the cost of living and weak hiring,,,,CNN,"Persistent worries about the higher cost of living and few job opportunities pushed consumer sentiment down to its seventh-lowest level in October, on records going back to 1952.
Consumer sentiment edged a hair lower early this month to a preliminary reading of 55, the University of Michigan said Friday — a weak level rarely seen in the post-World War II era. It’s slightly above the lows it reached this spring when President Donald Trump unveiled massive tariffs.
“Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers’ minds,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release. “Consumers do not expect meaningful improvement in these factors.”
The shutdown of the federal government , which stretched into its tenth day on Friday, has not so far affected Americans’ perceptions about the economy, according to the survey. More than a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay.
“Interviews reveal little evidence that the ongoing federal government shutdown has moved consumers’ views of the economy thus far,” Hsu said.
The macroeconomic effects of the shutdown aren’t significant, according to economists, but they get bigger the longer it lasts. The next Senate vote to fund the government is scheduled for Tuesday , though Congress appears to remain deadlocked.
After a brief recovery, America’s economic mood began to sour again in recent months on growing frustrations about higher prices and a weakening labor market, according to various surveys. Friday’s survey showed “declines in expectations for future personal finances as well as current buying conditions for durables.”
Still, that may not mean much for the US economy: Sentiment hasn’t been a good predictor of future spending in recent years. In the summer of 2022 when inflation was running at 40-year highs, sentiment plummeted to its lowest level on record, but Americans continued to spend later that year.
That dynamic has persisted. Sentiment has been weak this year, but Americans haven’t cut back on their spending. Retail sales increased in August for the third consecutive month, according to Commerce Department data, rising 0.6% from the prior month.
Economists say spending largely hinges on the health of the labor market, which has slowed recently, but remains fairly solid, with unemployment still relatively low. So long as layoffs aren’t surging, Americans will likely continue to spend, despite their economic jitters.
But with the federal government shut down, the release of crucial economic statistics has been suspended, including the monthly jobs report, which was scheduled for October 3. However, alternative data by private companies and Federal Reserve regional banks, which aren’t as affected by the shutdown, showed that the labor market continued to slow last month.
“Many of the themes from September carried into October with the tough job market not inspiring confidence alongside persistent cost-of-living and high interest rate concerns,” Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, wrote in an analyst note Friday."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/media/portland-frog-costume-chicken-protest-ice-trump-chicago,Protest frogs vs. MAGA media influencers: the information war over ICE in Portland and Chicago,,,,CNN,"A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free here .
As the Department of Homeland Security floods social media with “ propaganda ” videos, and pro-Trump commentators flock to Portland and Chicago in search of a “ rebellion ,” local residents are responding with… chicken suits and clever jokes.
Thursday night on ABC, Jimmy Kimmel tossed to a “special report” from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, “ reporting from war-torn Chicago .”
Pritzker, wearing body armor, played a TV reporter in the video clip. “We’ve seen people being forced to eat hot dogs with ketchup on them,” the governor quipped.
While Kimmel’s show was airing, a real reporter for The Oregonian was recording a video outside the ICE facility that has long been a magnet for protests in Portland. The topic: “ Protest frogs are multiplying .”
The video showcased how Portlanders are wearing inflatable costumes to mock what one of the frog cosplayers called “insane government overreach.”
The dress-up “dismantles their narrative a little bit,” Jack Dickinson, also known as the “Portland Chicken,” told Willamette Week . “It becomes much harder to take them seriously when they have to post a video saying Kristi Noem is up on the balcony staring over the Antifa Army and it’s, like, eight journalists and five protesters and one of them is in a chicken suit.”
Pritzker and Dickinson have something in common: They’re using the tools at their disposal — smart phone cameras, social media apps and satire — to turn “war” rhetoric into a punchline. “The Daily Show” did it too, with this clip labeled “REAL footage from Portland, 2025. Viewer discretion is advised.”
Conservative journalist Andy Ngo pushed back early Friday morning by claiming the costumes in Portland “serve the function of masking the violent extremism to make the direct action appear like a family-friendly gathering on camera, and to whitewash the past ultraviolence.”
So, as always, it comes down to which videos and posts people choose to believe.
However, “in the bifurcated media world of 2025, one side’s comparative calm is the other’s ‘hellscape’ — as the White House described Portland on Wednesday — and the narrative that the Trump administration has wanted has been supplied by a coterie of right-wing influencers elevated by Mr. Trump himself,” The New York Times’s Anna Griffin and Aaron West wrote in a new piece this morning .
Trump’s anti-Antifa roundtable is just one example. “Right-wing podcasters, writers and pundits are flocking to Democratic deep-blue cities to document the scene for their massive audiences but also, in some cases such as Portland, to spar with left-wing demonstrators,” NBC’s David Ingram and Jo Yurcaba reported .
It’s often helpful to think of pseudo-events like these anti-ICE protests as stages, because then you can observe the performers accordingly.
Take this quote, for example: Local TV reporter-turned-MAGA poster Jonathan Choe told NBC , “This is now a full-blown information war that we’re in, so being on the front lines is more important than ever…”
Sometimes a simple photo montage can serve as the most powerful fact-check.
Earlier this week, when President Trump resumed his insistence that “Portland is on fire,” I logged onto Getty Images and searched for photos from Oregon.
Photographer Spencer Platt had just published dozens of gorgeous day-in-the-life-of-the-city shots. A man sunbathing in a public square; a woman ordering coffee; a couple strolling through a park; this was the reality in the city Trump called a “hellhole.”
Yes, Platt also took photos at night of officers standing in formation while protesters gathered outside the ICE facility. But the photos showed the disconnect between Trump’s “Portland is burning to the ground” rhetoric and the on-the-scene reality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting did something similar last weekend, producing an Instagram video with timestamped photos that contradicted Trump’s hyperbole.
“Our OPB team is reporting the facts on the ground as they unfold with as much context as we can offer,” said the network’s CEO, Rachel Smolkin. “When the facts diverge from statements about the city, we note the discrepancies. Video and photos are powerful reporting tools in this type of news coverage.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/cindy-mccain-stroke-world-food-program,Cindy McCain suffers a mild stroke and will take leave from World Food Program while recovering,,,,CNN,"Cindy McCain, the widow of Sen. John McCain and head of the UN World Food Program , suffered a mild stroke this week and is said to be recovering “well,” according to a press release Thursday from the humanitarian organization.
The statement said McCain, 71, is expected to make a “full recovery” and will be traveling from Rome, where the WFP is based, to Arizona to focus on her recuperation. She will return to her post after her doctors have cleared her in four to six weeks.
“I want to thank the medical staff in Italy for the excellent treatment I received,” said McCain. “My recovery is progressing well thanks to their outstanding care.”
McCain was appointed in March 2023 to lead the world’s largest humanitarian organization after serving as US ambassador to the UN agencies for food and agriculture under former President Joe Biden. McCain broke with Republicans when she endorsed Biden for president in 2020, making her a key surrogate for the Democrat after now-President Donald Trump spent years criticizing her husband and his military service.
She has since become the face of the World Food Program, one of the few UN agencies that has received bipartisan support for its efforts to help nearly 150 million people confronting conflicts, disasters and impacts of climate change this year. McCain and the WFP have been in the spotlight as the agency has sought to respond to the humanitarian crises caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Israel’s offensive inside the Gaza Strip.
In late August, after visiting Gaza, McCain told The Associated Press it was “very evident” that there isn’t enough food in the Palestinian territory . She said she had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the urgent need for more aid.
Her comments came a week after the world’s leading authority on food crises said the Gaza Strip’s largest city is gripped by famine , and that it was likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.
“I personally met mothers and children who were starving in Gaza,” she said. “It is real and it is happening now,”
An advocate for children, McCain has served on the board of directors for Operation Smile, a nonprofit organization dedicated to addressing facial deformities for children around the world, visiting India, Morocco and Vietnam, the joint announcement said.
McCain succeeded David Beasley, a former South Carolina governor who had led WFP through challenging times, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the global food crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Beasley was at the helm when the World Food Program was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 , in part for being “a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.”
Carl Skau, the deputy executive director of WFP, is expected to oversee the organization’s day-to-day operations until McCain’s return.
In the statement Thursday, McCain said she has “full confidence” in her leadership team’s ability “to stay laser-focused on delivering urgently needed food assistance to the more than 100 million people WFP is working to serve across 87 countries.”
She added, “The fight against hunger has never been more critical, and I am incredibly proud of the work our teams do every day. I look forward to being back in the field soon — alongside WFP teams — pushing back against famine and supporting communities in need.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/entertainment/aziz-ansari-riyadh-human-rights-watch-donation,Here’s what Aziz Ansari can do with his Riyadh Comedy Festival money,,,,CNN,"During a recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel’s late night show, Aziz Ansari defended his decision to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival.
He also said he planned on donating part of the fee he earned to “causes that support free press and human rights.”
Human Rights Watch has said no thanks.
Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, told CNN there has so far been no donation from Ansari, but also said that the organization would not accept one from him. They also pledged not to accept money from any of the other comedians who participated in the state-run comedy festival held in Saudi Arabia.
Shea explained that the organization “cannot take government funding directly or indirectly, and we’re also very careful about how we accept private funding as well.”
Instead of monetary donations, Human Rights Watch would like the comedians to advocate for the release of Saudi human rights defenders, including Manahel al-Otaibi and Waleed Abulkhair, who have been imprisoned by the government.

Shea said her organization reached out privately to the comedians who performed, including Ansari, with a list of names of such defenders in an attempt to get them to draw attention to those who have been persecuted.
“We just feel if you are going to be performing, taking Saudi government money to perform at a state-backed festival, you have a responsibility to mitigate the impacts of that reputation laundering,” Shea told CNN. “And for that we suggested to publicly call for the release of these Saudi human rights defenders.”
Kimmel pressed Ansari during their interview about his performance at the event in light of what the late night talk show host said is a “pretty brutal regime” that has “done a lot of horrible, horrible things.”
Saudi activist gets 15-year sentence for ‘inciting public opinion’
“People are questioning why you would go over there and take their money to perform in front of these people,” Kimmel asked Ansari. “I’m curious as to why you decided to do that.”
“There’s people over there that don’t agree with the stuff that the government’s doing, and to ascribe like the worst behavior of the government onto those people, that’s not fair,” said Ansari, who also said he had put a great deal of thought into the decision.
The country is under the Islamic regime essentially led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is at the center of several complaints of human rights violations, including the 2018 state-sponsored murder of reporter Jamal Khashoggi. He has denied any involvement .
CNN has reached out to reps for Ansari for comment.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/middleeast/gaza-palestinians-photos-before-after-war-intl-cmd,"See how two years of war, loss and heartbreak has changed these Palestinians in Gaza",,,,CNN,"It’s been two years since Hamas’ attack on October 7 led to Israel’s war in Gaza and life in the enclave has never been harder.
With at least 67,173 people killed and another 169,780 injured, one in nine people alive in Gaza before the war has been wounded or is dead, the Ministry of Health in the enclave reported on Tuesday.
A “man-made” famine is spreading across the territory and the vast majority of people have lost their homes and livelihoods. Many have lost hope too, despite the indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas currently underway in Egypt.
Israel launched the war after the October 7, 2023 terror attacks in which Hamas and its allies killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 hostages to Gaza.
Israel’s conduct in the war has been such that international experts, including the International Association of Genocide Scholars, two leading Israeli human rights organizations and an independent United Nations inquiry, have concluded that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza – ﻿an accusation the Israeli government has consistently denied.
For people in Gaza, life has long become about survival. About trying, and almost always failing, to secure the basic necessities for their loved ones.
Here are the stories of a few of them, shared with CNN through messages and phone calls.
For months, Mahmoud Nabil Faraj and his family have been surviving on one meal a day. But there have been many occasions when he had no choice but to forgo food altogether, he said, to make sure that his 7-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, at least, could eat something.
“These are the hardest days we’ve ever lived,” he told CNN. “Our children are deprived of the basic foods needed to grow, and our bodies have become frail and weak due to the lack of nutrition.”
Most of the time now there is no food or water, he said. “When there is some, it barely meets the minimum requirements for survival. There are no fruits whatsoever. Milk and dairy products are unavailable. Eggs are 100% missing. Meat and poultry are also unavailable.”
How Israeli actions caused famine in Gaza, visualized
Many people, himself included, are now suffering from frequent dizziness because of persistently low blood sugar, he said.
“The prices of basic goods are skyrocketing… only God knows how we manage to afford even that one meal,” he told CNN. When available – which is not often – a single kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar now sells for $150, he said.
Before the war, Faraj owned a grocery store and his wife ran an optometry center in Shuja’iyya, an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza City. Both businesses have been destroyed in Israeli attacks, as was their home, he said. They fled the area before the strikes.
“We used to eat the finest food and wear the nicest clothes,” Faraj said. “Now we are displaced in western Gaza.”
Faraj said he was 253 pounds before the war started two years ago. Now, he weighs no more than 154 pounds.
Raghad Izzat Hammouda has been hungry and malnourished for many months, surviving on a poor diet of small quantities of mostly canned food.
But it is her six younger siblings she is most worried about.
“They had beautiful dreams; they aspired to travel, get an education and obtain excellence certificates. But today, their highest dream is to gather firewood and fetch water, and they are happy if they eat a morsel of bread? Can you imagine that?” the 20-year-old from Gaza City told CNN.
She said her parents often skip meals and give all of the food they have to the children.
“My mother and father are suffering greatly. Like all of the parents in Gaza, when they see their children hungry and crying because they are thirsty and hungry,” she said.
Hammouda said there is no fruit or meat at the markets in Gaza, and that the few vegetables that are available are so expensive they remain out of reach.
“Before the war, my family’s food was varied and diverse… But now, unfortunately, none of that is available,” she said. “Right now, all our food consists of canned goods… canned fava beans, peas, canned meat, and so on … and legumes like chickpeas, lentils and beans.”
She said she has lost 10 relatives in the war, including her 80-year-old grandmother, Tamam, who she said was killed by Israeli forces.
“They did not allow us to bury her until a week after her death,” she said.
Mohammed Saeed Al-Khatib was stunned when he saw a photo a friend took of him.
“I was shocked by how much I had changed in appearance. We no longer have mirrors, and I hadn’t seen myself in a long time,” he told CNN.
Al-Khatib reckons he has lost more than a third of his weight since the war started in Gaza, dropping from 143 kilograms (315 pounds) to roughly 90 kilos (200 pounds).
The 42-year-old is from the Al-Zahra neighborhood in Gaza City, a place he said used to be one of the most beautiful areas in the whole of Gaza.
Over the past two years, it has been destroyed by relentless Israeli aerial and ground attacks.
“My children’s lives changed drastically: no schools, no health care, no proper food or clean water. Diseases surround them from every direction,” he said.
Global outrage has grown after two years of bombardment in Gaza. In Israel, it is a different story
Al-Khatib has four children: Saba, 12, Hussein, 9, Julia, 4, and Hassan, who is just 2 years old.
Al-Khatib’s home an﻿d almost everything his family owned is long gone. He said they have been displaced more than six times, living in tents and rented apartments across Gaza.
Finding food and water is a daily struggle, he said. At many points during the past two years, Al-Khatib and his family had no choice but to take desperate measures to survive.
“We used spoiled flour infested with insects and worms just to feed the children. We cleaned and ate rotting vegetables, consumed rice unfit for human consumption, ate expired canned goods, and drank unsafe water,” he said.
Mohammed Matar says he had a good lif﻿e before the war started.
He worked as a graphic designer and his family always had enough to eat and drink. Their financial situation was good enough to allow them to go out and have fun on a regular basis. And as someone who had always been on the heavier side, he had spent decades trying to lose weight, never quite succeeding.
It’s a life that seems so distant now that it’s almost impossible to imagine.
“My children suffer from health issues and malnutrition. One is 4 years old, the other one is 2,” he said.
“We buy one kilo of flour and try to make it last for two and a half days. Sometimes I go to sleep without dinner so that my son can go to kindergarten and at least eat half a loaf of bread in the morning,” he told CNN.
Matar said he can see the impacts of this lack of nutritious food on his own body. He has lost a significant amount of weight in the past two months and feels exhausted. His hands ache. Carrying a bucket of water to the second floor has become a task that is physically too difficult now, he said.
He and his family — his wife and two young children — were displaced from their home in the Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City to Rafah in the south early in the war.
When Israeli troops entered Rafah, the family moved to just west of Al-Qarara near Khan Younis. When the Israelis began closing in on that area, they fled to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.
The rest of his family is scattered all over.
“My mother and two sisters are in Al-Maghazi (in central Gaza), one brother is in Gaza City, and I have a sister in Turkey. I am always thinking of them,” he said.
Forty-year-old Eyad Amawi has been watching his children waste away despite his best efforts to keep them fed and healthy.
He told CNN they have all lost a significant amount of weight and are struggling with weakness. His youngest son, Youssef, who is only 4 years old, is suffering from liver inflammation and intestinal infections caused by severe malnutrition, he said.
“My wife and I often do not eat at all so there is enough food for the children. We adults reduce our portions, especially of bread, so the children can have it. But bread alone is not enough to survive without nutritious food. And to this day, meat, eggs, chicken, and other essential nutritious items are not allowed to enter,” he said.
Amawi and his family have been displaced in Deir al-Balah due to heavy bombardment in his neighbourhood in Gaza City. He said they have not eaten in a normal way since the war began.
“Sometimes we manage through small aid distributions or by buying flour when it is available during the tight blockade. Most of the time we rely only on lentils or rice, and in rare periods we managed to get some potatoes,” he said.
He said the war has changed every aspect of the family’s life. Several of his relatives have been killed and some of his nieces and nephews have been injured.
“These losses have left a deep wound in our family,” he said. “We have lost our normal life and lost hope. Our lives changed from stability and safety to constant fear; from having electricity, water and food to struggling to find the most basic essentials.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/science/iucn-red-list-update-conservation-congress-spc,"IUCN Red List: Arctic seals on brink of extinction, global birds deArctic seals face extinction and birds in decline globally.",,,,CNN,"Melting sea ice and deforestation are continuing to drive many species toward extinction, with the latest Red List of Threatened Species showing that more than a quarter of all animals, plants and fungi assessed are at risk.
Three species of Arctic seals now face extinction due to global warming, while half the planet’s birds are in decline due to habitat loss. But the return of the green sea turtle shows how, with coordinated conservation efforts, things can be turned around.
The Red List, produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the most authoritative global assessment of extinction risk of species. Released today at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, the updated database includes 172,620 species of which 48,646 are threatened with extinction.
“The Red List records symptoms of extinctions,” said Jon Paul Rodríguez, chair of IUCN’s Species Survival Commission, speaking to CNN via video call from the conference. “It’s like a thermometer when you are sick… you’re measuring something that tells you there’s something wrong; we have to act.”
“The forces behind degradation of biodiversity are big and they’re widespread and strong,” he added. “But it’s not that we don’t know what to do, it’s just that there are fewer of us with fewer resources than are needed.”
The research highlights the plight of Arctic seals, which rely on sea ice for breeding and raising their pups, and use it to rest and access foraging areas. As the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, sea ice is rapidly retreating. As a result, the hooded seal is listed as endangered, and the bearded seal and harp seal are near-threatened.
Thinning sea ice will also threaten other seal species, walruses and marine mammals in the region, according to the update. It will have a wider ecosystem impact, affecting the food web as species such as polar bears have fewer seals to prey on.
“Protecting Arctic seals goes beyond these species; it is about safeguarding the Arctic’s delicate balance, which is essential for us all,” said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group and biodiversity research leader at the Norwegian Polar Institute, in a statement.

The update also included a significant reassessment of the state of the world’s birds, which involved thousands of experts over a nine-year period. It found that 61% of bird species are in decline globally, up from 44% in 2016. This is mainly due to habitat loss and degradation, driven especially by agriculture and logging.
Madagascar, West Africa and Central America were highlighted as at-risk regions, due to the loss of tropical forest. Some threatened species, such as the black-casqued hornbill, found in West and Central Africa, are also under increased threat due to hunting and wildlife trade.
Hornbills are a key example of the vital role birds can play in the wider ecosystem. In some areas, they are collectively able to disperse up to 12,700 large seeds per kilometer each day , making them critical in maintaining healthy and diverse ecosystems and restoring degraded areas. Birds also serve as pollinators, pest controllers and scavengers.
Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International, the IUCN Red List authority on birds, said in a statement that the findings show “how deep the biodiversity crisis has become” and he urged governments to take strong action.
The new research offered one glimmer of hope, as populations of the green sea turtle are rebounding thanks to conservation efforts. Found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide, it is now listed as of least concern rather than endangered, as populations have increased by around 28% since the 1970s.
Decades of conservation action have mainly focused on protecting nesting females and their eggs and curtailing trade and the unsustainable harvest of turtles and their eggs. The report notes the efforts in Ascension Island, Brazil, Mexico and Hawaii as particularly successful, with some populations rebounding to close to pre-commercial exploitation levels.
But it warns that the species is not in the clear yet, as much of its habitat is still vulnerable to coastal and marine development and climate change is also having an impact.
The Red List is updated regularly to refresh existing assessments and include species assessed for the first time. The last update was in March 2025.
Rodríguez said that the database is the first step in developing conservation strategies and taking action. “Resources are limited and we have to prioritize. We have to think of ways to cleverly invest the money where it will have the biggest impact, and the Red List is a key piece of information to do that,” he said.

The IUCN World Conservation Congress is held once every four years and is an opportunity for conservation leaders, academics, Indigenous peoples and decision-makers from government and business to work together on improving the natural environment. This year’s event in Abu Dhabi is the first time the Congress has been held in the Gulf region, and Emirati Razan Al Mubarak is the current IUCN president.
“We look at the biggest challenges facing conservation around the world, and we try to build on the strengths and the knowledge of all of these voices,” said Rodríguez. “What comes out of the Congress is a good measure of what the world knows and what the priorities are.”
Now, all eyes are on next month’s UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) held in Brazil. “We see climate and biodiversity as two sides of the same coin: damaging biodiversity affects the climate, improving biodiversity helps with the climate,” he added. “We hope the messages we can produce here will influence the discussions and the thinking of people at the climate COP.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/sport/baseball-mlb-dodgers-phillies-game-4-intl,Philadelphia Phillies crash out of MLB postseason after a baffling error against Los Angeles Dodgers,,,,CNN,"Look away now, Philly faithful.
It was another heartbreaking night for the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday, after a disastrous error in the 11th inning of Game 4 saw them crash out of the MLB postseason at the hands of the Los Angeles Dodgers .
The Dodgers won 2-1 on the night to clinch a NL Division Series win and advance to the NL Championship Series (NLCS), but the game will likely be remembered more for how the Phillies lost it, than how the Dodgers won.
Extra innings were needed to separate the two teams at Dodger Stadium after a tense contest saw Phillies right fielder Nick Castellanos driving in Max Kepler in the top of the seventh and Justin Dean scoring for LA off a walk with the bases loaded in the bottom of the inning.
The stage was then set for a moment the Phillies and pitcher Orion Kerkering would love to forget as quickly as possible.
Toronto Blue Jays knock out New York Yankees to reach first ALCS in nine years
With the bases loaded and two outs in the 11th, Dodgers outfielder Andy Pages struck a routine ground ball back towards Kerkering.
On any normal given day, the reliever would have thrown to first base for an easy out, but the occasion seemed to get to the 24-year-old.
Instead, he fumbled the ball, before trying to throw back to home plate, where his attempt totally missed Phillies catcher JT Realmuto’s outstretched mitt. The baffling error allowed Kim Hye-seong to score the winning run and send the home fans into a frenzy.
During the incident, Realmuto was seen pointing for Kerkering to throw to first base and, afterwards, Kim said he was equally surprised the pitcher chose to throw home. The Dodgers second baseman initially ran past home plate before returning to touch it.
While wild celebrations sparked around him, Kerkering was left standing motionless, head bowed, in the middle of the field, before some of his Phillies teammates came to comfort him.
“Just hit off my foot,” Kerkering, still visibly emotional, told reporters after the game.
“Once the pressure got to me, I just thought there’s a little faster throw to JT, little quicker throw than trying to cross-body it to Bryce (Harper at first). So just a horsesh*t throw.”
Kerkering added that his Phillies teammates were quick to shoulder some of the blame themselves for several missed opportunities throughout the game.
Philadelphia manager Rob Thomson also had words of support for Kerkering when speaking to reporters after the defeat. The pair had been seen speaking together as the relief pitcher trudged off the field.
“He just got caught up in the moment a little bit,” Thomson said . “Coming down the stretch, he pitched so well for us.
“I feel for him because he’s putting it all on his shoulders, but we win as a team and lose as a team.”
The Dodgers, meanwhile, progressed into the NLCS for the eighth time in the last 13 seasons, where they will face either the Chicago Cubs or the Milwaukee Brewers – who play a series-deciding Game 5 of their NLDS on Saturday night in Wisconsin after the Cubs won Game 4 6-0 at Wrigley Field.
The team’s celebrations in the locker room post-game showed a squad eager to enjoy every bit of its World Series title defense.
“That was a nail-biter,” Dodgers catcher Will Smith, soaked in beer, said after the victory. “They cracked. We didn’t.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/entertainment/black-people-bad-bunny-super-bowl,People really are learning Spanish for Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl show,,,,CNN,"Bad Bunny told America on “Saturday Night Live” last week that people still have a few months to learn Spanish to get ready to best enjoy his Super Bowl halftime show performance.
Some Black people aren’t playing about it, as seen on social media.
There’s a groundswell of support bubbling up for the international superstar, with plenty of posts and comments among Black people celebrating Bad Bunny’s selection for the prestigious gig.
It’s a national conversation about who gets represented on one of the biggest stages in American sports and entertainment – and how language and identity play into that.
Actor and creator O’Neil Thomas has shared massively successful posts about learning Spanish in the time since Bad Bunny and the NFL made the consequential announcement.
A post shared by O'Neil Thomas (@oneilthomas)
Puerto Rican singing sensation and actor Ricky Martin liked Thomas’ first post ; language education app Duolingo commented, “I see a 4 month Spanish streak in your future.” The post amassed more than 9 million views.
Thomas told CNN in a recent interview that he’s been Facetiming with his Dominican friend to learn Bad Bunny music lyrics and how to properly pronounce necessary words. His family is getting in on the Spanish lessons, since they always watch the halftime show together. This year, they will be joined by some of his Latino friends.
“I think right now we can all agree that there is a large amount of divisiveness and dividing in a country that is meant to be a pool of multiple walks of life and different cultures and communities,” Thomas said. “So I think Bad Bunny is the perfect person to be at the forefront of reminding this country what is so great.”
It’s a different conversation than what was being had soon after the presidential election in November 2024.
At that time, there was discontent among some in the Black community with the increased support for Donald Trump among Latino voters.
CNN’s national exit poll found Trump won 54 percent of Latino men compared to Harris’ 44 percent — an 18-point increase in Latino Republican turnout from 2020.
But Latinos are not a monolith. And Bad Bunny, who was born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio in Puerto Rico, has been an outspoken critic of the current administration.
His criticism has led supporters of the president to label him a “Trump hater,” and they’ve called for him to be replaced as the halftime performer.
Even President Trump and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson have weighed in.
“I don’t know who he is. I don’t know why they’re doing it — it’s, like, crazy,” Trump said in a recent interview with Newsmax. “Then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”
“I didn’t even know who Bad Bunny was, but it sounds like a terrible decision in my view,” Johnson said, suggesting 82-year-old country musician Lee Greenwood, whose song “God Bless the USA” is one of President Trump’s favorites, perform instead.
It’s hard to make the argument that Bad Bunny is not a big enough star to have earned the accolade, given that he is a three-time Grammy winner who recently completed a sold out two-month residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan – a series that wrapped with a concert that broke streaming records on Amazon and brought in millions of dollars for the local economy in his beloved Puerto Rico.
But in the US, his critics have attempted to paint him as anti-American despite the fact that he is an American (Puerto Rico is a territory of the US). Bad Bunny declined to bring his tour to mainland USA for fear that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement would pose a danger to his fans in attendance.
Emil Medina worked with Bad Bunny for four years as the founder and chief operating officer of Buena Vibra Group, a Puerto Rican creative firm. Medina said the artist is a “creative genius” who is “like a sponge” and very much tapped into all the conversation being had about and around him.
Bad Bunny is also someone who stands firm in his support of marginalized people.
“We’re the agency that helped Bad Bunny promote his first years and we started sharing info (with Bad Bunny) about the social injustice in United States because he wants to do the crossover (into the US market),” Medina explained. “And in 2020, when the George Floyd incident happened, we created a local statement (in Puerto Rico) with Black Lives Matter. People were not aware about Black Lives Matter, and we created a big footprint and some murals on the streets and Bad Bunny was a strong advocate.”
Puerto Rico is the home of “African Caribbeans and we have a strong connection with the African American community,” Medina said.
He added that “here in Puerto Rico, we support all the African American issues,” and pointed out that young Puerto Ricans in particular are politically engaged.
“They’re very active, they are very well outspoken about those issues,” Medina said. “And that’s the biggest fandom of Bad Bunny.”
Albert Laguna, an associate professor of American Studies and Ethnicity, Race, & Migration at Yale University, noted that when it comes to Bad Bunny, “he’s the number one streamed artist across the world. There’s something about his music that’s really sticking with people.”
“In the context of Black communities, it’s an opportunity to talk about the Black roots, right? The Afro-Puerto Rican, Afro-Caribbean roots of so much of his music that is ringing bells for folks right across the global Black diaspora,” Laguna said. “You can’t talk about reggaeton without talking about hip-hop. Hip-hop is born in the South Bronx with West Indians, African-Americans, and Puerto Ricans creating this music that travels to Puerto Rico, mixes with Jamaican dance hall, mixes with Panamanian reggae en Español to form this reggaeton.”
And there is no bigger star in the reggaeton genre than Bad Bunny, who started out as an Latin trap music artist and is now known for blending the genres of pop, hip-hop, trap, reggae, rock, soul and world music.
He has clearly also expanded his reach in pop culture, having recently hosted “Saturday Night Live” for the second time and also, of course, having been selected to headline next year’s Super Bowl halftime show .
Laguna said the ensuing backlash to his selection for the big sporting event was “predictable,” but he liked how the star handled it.
“He didn’t kind of get in the mud with people criticizing him from the right. He just said ‘learn some Spanish, they could listen to the show,’ which I thought was quite funny,” Laguna said of Bad Bunny’s buzzy “SNL” monologue over the weekend.
“I also think on some level what’s bothering folks is like, he’s gonna come on his US passport. You can’t revoke a visa, there are no games you can play with (his) immigration, right?” he added. “He can come and play the Super Bowl and sing in Spanish, and there’s not much that could be done to stop him.”
Historian and content creator Anthony Modesto Milian told CNN that as an Afro-Latino, he feels “very prideful” and “super ecstatic” about Bad Bunny’s selection by the NFL.
“I was telling my friend the other day, what a time to be Puerto Rican,” he said. “Bad Bunny is shining light on all of us. He’s shining light on the whole diaspora.”
He said it should be no surprise “that African American people are locked in with Puerto Ricans in their appreciation and love for Bad Bunny,” adding that both African Americans and Latinos have felt targeted by the current administration.
“If you look at the history of Puerto Ricans when they left the island, a lot of them moved to places where they lived alongside African American people,” Milian said. “The Bronx, Brooklyn, Connecticut, Massachusetts, places like that. And so it’s really more of like a familial thing.”
The influencer said there is one family member he wishes was still here to witness how far Bad Bunny has come.
Milian said his father, who passed away two years ago, was “old school” and not as much a fan of Bad Bunny’s earlier reggaeton style.
“But when I listened to this album, he did a lot of salsa, he did a lot of traditional music,” he said of the artist’s most recent record. “And the thing about the name of the album, ‘I Should’ve Taken More Photos’ (‘ DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS’ ) is I wish that my dad was still here to hear the music that he put out now, because I know he would’ve loved it.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/middleeast/trump-ceasefire-israel-hamas-gaza-explainer-intl,What we know and don’t know about Trump’s deal to end the war in Gaza,,,,CNN,"After months of delays and disappointments, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza on Friday.
Thousands of Palestinians have begun walking from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City in the north. The Israeli military is pulling back its forces, in accordance with the deal approved by Israel’s government overnight.
US President Donald Trump announced the agreement in a short Truth Social post on Wednesday. Although the ceasefire represents a major diplomatic breakthrough for his administration, it leaves much to be decided.
It is not clear whether Israel and Hamas will agree to other conditions proposed by Trump relating to thornier questions of what Gaza will look like after the war.
Here’s what we know about the deal so far.
The US president broke news of an agreement on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, saying it would lead to the swift release of hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed line.
After a late-night government approval, the Israeli military on Friday said that the ceasefire is in effect, and that its forces had begun to withdraw to an agreed-upon line.
Hamas’ chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said Thursday that the group has received guarantees from the US and international mediators confirming that this deal means “the war has ended permanently,” rather than representing a temporary ceasefire, as on previous occasions.
However, it is not clear if the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office has given the order to the Israel Defense Forces to cease fire.
Eyewitnesses reported Israeli airstrikes and artillery shelling in the center of Khan Younis and in Gaza City early Friday morning. Footage from a Reuters camera positioned in southern Israel also showed large plumes of smoke seen rising into the air in Gaza on Friday morning.
Israel’s partial withdrawal from Gaza is expected to take fewer than 24 hours. There will also be a 24-hour window during which petitions objecting to the deal can be submitted to the Israeli High Court. Once this objection window closes, Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, two Israeli officials told CNN.
Another Israeli source said the assumption is that hostages will be released before these 72 hours pass. Trump said earlier that they should be released on Monday or Tuesday.
Under the plan, all the living hostages are set to be released together, without any ceremony. The remains of deceased hostages must also be returned during that period.
Twenty hostages are believed to be alive, with grave concerns for the well-being of two of them. A further 28 hostages are deceased. CNN previously reported Hamas may not be able to find them all.
Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said that 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences will also be released, along with 1,700 others held in Israeli jails.
But an Israeli source familiar with the matter said Thursday that negotiating teams are still working on the list of prisoners to be released and that the issue “has not yet been resolved.” The source said that any prisoner convicted of murder would not be released to the occupied West Bank and that their transfer to a third country had not yet been determined.
Marwan Barghouti , the Palestinian political leader who has been imprisoned by Israel since 2002, will not be released, the Israeli government spokesperson said.
The warring parties have still not agreed to major sticking points tackled in Trump’s more comprehensive 20-point plan released last month. Those include:
• Disarmament: Trump’s plan called for Hamas to “commit to peaceful co-existence” with Israel and lay down its arms. Hamas members who comply will be given amnesty under the plan. Disarmament has long been a red line for the militant group.
•  Post-war governance: The plan also called for a temporary transitional government to be established in Gaza, comprising a “technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” made up of “qualified Palestinians and international experts” and supervised by “a new international transitional body” called the Board of Peace.
Trump appeared to reference this board during an interview with Fox News, saying that his administration was “forming a council of peace” to maintain a lasting end to the conflict in the region.
But it is not yet known which individuals will be appointed to these bodies, nor how it will exercise authority over Gaza.
•  ﻿Israeli withdrawal: Trump’s plan also called for the creation of an “International Stabilization Force (ISF)” to be deployed to Gaza and train “vetted Palestinian police forces” in Gaza. With this force in place, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would then be expected to withdraw from Gaza. Israel has not yet agreed to these provisions.
• Security guarantees: Hamas has long sought concrete assurances that Israel will not resume the war once it ends, pointing to how Israel shattered the last ceasefire agreement in March. If Hamas agrees to disarm, it is likely to demand even more robust security guarantees, but it is not clear whether Israel will agree to them.
If the ceasefire holds and Israel withdraws to the agreed-upon line in Gaza, the hostages could be released Monday. That timeline is uncertain, however, and the release could happen sooner.
Whereas small groups of hostages have been released each week under previous ceasefires, Trump has insisted that all hostages be released at once.
Substantive discussions have not yet begun over what comes next for the war-torn Gaza Strip, with the current focus on implementation of the ceasefire and hostage-release deal, an Israeli official and another regional source told CNN.
The negotiators in Egypt this week set up committees on multiple tracks to tackle the next steps in the overall plan, the regional source said. But active discussions on those topics will begin after the first phase of the deal, the source added.
Implementing the full framework of Trump’s plan would likely spark a revolt among the hard-line members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition. Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, two far-right ministers, say Trump’s plan represents a defeat for Israel and could threaten government stability if the peace plan progresses.
Meanwhile, Trump told Axios reporter and CNN analyst Barak Ravid that he plans to travel to Israel in the coming days. “They want me to give a speech at the Knesset,” he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/travel/eu-entry-exit-system-explained,The EU’s Entry/Exit system will change Europe travel rules. Here’s what you need to know,,,,CNN,"The long wait is over.
After years of planning and myriad delays, the European Union’s Entry/Exit system (EES) will go live on October 12.
While nothing has changed when it comes to the rules of who can enter the EU, and how long they can stay, the new system will track cross-border movements in the Schengen area of 29 countries. This will be done by capturing the biometric data of visitors — just as other countries, including the US, already do.
How will it work, and how could it impact your vacation? Here’s all you need to know.
The EU’s Entry/Exit System will capture biometric data from non-EU citizens entering the Schengen area (essentially all EU states except Cyprus and Ireland, plus Switzerland, Iceland and Norway). In the same way that visitors are fingerprinted entering the US, travelers to the EU will be fingerprinted when they enter the bloc — and again, when they leave.
The aims are two-fold: to reduce crime and illegal cross-border movement, but also to ensure that visitors are not overstaying their welcome. Third-party nationals, as non-EU citizens are termed, are only allowed to spend 90 out of every 180 days in the bloc.
The system should be simple, checking faces and fingerprints against the biometric data already on record. But creating the record will be a little more time-consuming. The first time a traveler encounters the system, they will have their photo and fingerprints taken, and passport data recorded. Border points across Schengen have already installed lines of self-service kiosks for travelers to register.
Once registered, on subsequent visits, your photo and fingerprints will be checked against what is already on the system. If you have a biometric passport and there are E-gates at your border crossing, you should be able to enter with that.
Not at first. To avoid the logistical logjams that had been predicted, the rollout is being staggered. Each member state can decide where and how they want to implement the system. The only requirements are that at 30 days in, countries must be registering 10% of travelers. By 90 days, they should be registering 35% of travelers, rising to 50% at 150 days. By day 180, on April 9, countries must be registering all travelers in the system.
At least one border crossing point in each EU country will need to have the system operational from October 12. The European Commission advises that member states roll it out at various crossing points by sea, air, and land.
Outside that guidance, countries are free to implement it as they want.
EU citizens must now apply and pay a fee to enter the UK
Your fingerprints and a photo of your face will be captured.
Also recorded will be your passport information (full name and date of birth), the dates and places of entry and exit into Schengen. If you were refused entry that will also be noted.
You’ll also be asked where you’re staying, and whether you have funds to cover your trip.
Officials are trying to minimize delays by rolling out implementation gradually, according to an EU official. However, they warn, “there might be some delays at the beginning.”
Self-service kiosks at entry points to register your initial details should help make things faster.
Not quite yet. Because the system is rolling out over the next six months, your passport will still be stamped at border crossings — even if you’ve gone through EES. That’s so that crossings not yet using the technology can still keep track of your days in the EU. Once the system is fully effective, which should be on April 9, the passport stamps will end.
Europe delays travel entry charges until 2025
It’ll be recorded on the system and visible at any future entry points.
The information will be stored for three years, so if you travel regularly into Schengen it will keep renewing. However, if you don’t travel in the next three years, you’ll need to reregister the next time you travel to the EU. There are strict rules on how your data is handled — see the website for full details.
You won’t need to reregister, says an EU spokesperson. Since your biometric details will already be in the system, the system will simply be updated with your new passport number.
No, because the EU already has your biometric data. The same goes for EU residents, regardless of their nationality. Legal residents will already have had their biometric data captured as part of the residency process.
The full list of those exempt from EES is here .
Children under 12 do not have to provide fingerprints but do have to go through the rest of the process.
Yes. Since Brexit, British citizens are counted as third-party nationals along with the rest of the world. The only exception is for Brits who are legally resident in the EU, or covered by the Withdrawal Agreement.
If you’re not great at math, there’s a handy official calculator here . Sanctions for overstayers range from fines to deportation and bloc-wide bans.
ETIAS is the new pre-travel visa waiver that will be launched by the EU, similar to the ESTA for travelers to the US. Having been postponed multiple times, the launch is now down for the end of next year, “probably,” according to an EU spokesman. An information campaign will be launched six months prior, so there’ll be notice."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/world/nepal-blinknow-maggie-doyne-cnnheroes-update,What started with her babysitting money has now changed thousands of lives in Nepal,,,,CNN,"It’s been 10 years since Maggie Doyne was named the 2015 CNN Hero of the Year for her work caring for and educating vulnerable children and orphans in rural Nepal.
What started with a plot of land that she purchased with her babysitting money has become a global model for poverty alleviation and development through her nonprofit, BlinkNow Foundation .
“It’s really a community vision for care and what children need to thrive,” Doyne, 38, said.
After high school, Doyne began her work after meeting a young girl in Surkhet, Nepal, whose life was ravaged during the country’s decades-long civil conflict.
Today, Doyne cares for 93 children, addressing their immediate needs and supporting them for long-term growth and self-sufficiency.
Her Kopila Valley School, once a small “bamboo shack,” has now served 1,000 students with state-of-the-art facilities, modern technology, and diverse course offerings. Students participate in gardening, farming, and conservation classes and are provided healthy meals to address malnutrition. There is an onsite daycare, as well as a job readiness program called “Futures” to launch students toward college, vocational programs, and job training.
“We’ve now raised a generation of children,” Doyne said. “They are out in the world as architects, engineers, social workers, teachers, and entrepreneurs.”
The Kopila Valley Children’s Home, once a one-story structure, is now a four-story Children’s Village, with a new facility set to open later this year. Doyne says her goal is to keep families together, but when that is not an option, her home offers safety, protection, and love to the most vulnerable children in the area.
The organization also has a separate home for at-risk girls who have been victims of trauma, human trafficking, and violence; a food and farming program that trains Indigenous women and farmers; and a full-service medical clinic. Doyne and a team of 175 caregivers, teachers, and professionals work together to offer comprehensive services that address the roots of poverty.
While Doyne’s last decade has been defined by enormous achievements, it has also come with profound heartache. On December 30, 2015, Doyne’s son Ravi died by accidental drowning. At one point, the traumatic loss made progress seem impossible.
“I didn’t know if I would recover,” Doyne said. “The years following were about putting the pieces back together and really healing as a family.”
At a speaking engagement in Los Angeles, Doyne connected with Jeremy Power Regimbal, a filmmaker who shared a passion for humanitarian causes and storytelling. He started documenting Doyne’s work and life story. And the two began a journey together, professionally and personally. Now married, they raise their biological children in Nepal amongst their 93 siblings.
“It’s been a chapter of partnership and building this beautiful family,” Doyne said. “We are very much committed to working hand in hand with our team and our community; continuing to spread the word of helping the orphan crisis.”
United by a shared mission to make a difference, Power Regimbal directed and filmed “ Between the Mountain and the Sky ,” a documentary released this year that highlights the raw and often painful realities of Doyne’s work.
“It definitely lifts the veil of heroism,” Doyne said. “By showing that vulnerability, it’s inspired people in a way that I never imagined.”
Hope and action are ideas that Doyne made a reality two decades ago. And today, her message remains: Anyone can make a difference, and small acts can have big impacts.
“Keep doing what you can, where you are,” she said. “Keep showing up, keep loving, keep going with your acts of kindness. It all matters.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/style/luca-guadagnino-after-the-hunt-costume-design-giulia-piersanti,Dressing a professor in crisis: The designer behind Julia Roberts’ outfits in Luca Guadagnino’s new film,,,,CNN,"In Luca Guadagnino’s new psychological thriller “After the Hunt,” Julia Roberts stars as a Yale professor who is forced to choose sides when a star pupil accuses another faculty member of sexual assault.
Each scene that unfolds is thorny and tense. And as the cast — including Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield who play the accuser and the accused, respectively — engage in an unflinching battle of wits, navigating one knotty maneuver after another, what stands out is their clothes, which are as sharp as the dialogue.
“After the Hunt” brings Guadagnino into more volatile territory as a filmmaker, but it has similarities to his past work in the visually rich sartorial choices of its cast, where the clothes contain deeper meaning and expresses the power dynamics between its characters. The result is made possible by the film’s costume designer Giulia Piersanti.
Whether teaching a class at the pristine Ivy League institution or grabbing a drink at a bar after hours, Roberts’ character Alma Imhoff has an unmistakable penchant for preppy, tailored cream-colored pieces, achieved with a wardrobe of luxury labels like The Row, Celine and Lemaire, though she also occasionally opts for vintage Ralph Lauren and L.L. Bean. And her style is mimicked throughout by Edibiri’s character Maggie Price (who wears clothes by young British designer Grace Wales Bonner, which is just as classy but not at the same extortionate price point). It is through these subtleties that viewers can deduce she has a yearning for Alma’s approval, and possibly more.
“I wanted to play around with the idea of the same type of looks but worn by different personalities and therefore with different styling and proportions,” said Piersanti in an interview with CNN in August from the Venice Film Festival, where the film premiered. “If you notice the women in the film, they all wear very similar items: blazers, button downs, it’s very academic. But Alma is the chicer contemporary version, while Maggie, who emulates Alma, wears a younger version of her looks.”
Piersanti was born in Rome but moved to Paris with her mother and sister, when she was seven. She relocated again, as a teen to Los Angeles for a few years, and then to New York to study at Parsons’ Design School of Fashion. When she turned 20 in the ’90s, she was offered the opportunity to work at  Miu Miu, so she packed her bags and headed to Milan.
Piersanti, who today lives between Milan and the Italian capital, found herself gravitating towards knitwear and decided to specialize in the craft, subsequently taking on design responsibilities at Paris-based labels Balenciaga, Lanvin, and Alaïa. Today, she works as the head of knitwear across womenswear and menswear for Celine, the French house owned by the world’s biggest luxury group LVMH, while also continuing her work in costume design.
“Most movies stay in the past or the present, to tell a story about a character. Fashion, on the other hand, is about the future.”
Giulia Piersanti, the designer behind the costumes for the film, ""After the Hunt,"" and in the knitwear department at French luxury label Celine
“Being a fashion designer was my dream ever since I was young, but costume design is something that I fell into,” Piersanti said. In hindsight, however, perhaps it isn’t too surprising. “When I was a teenager, I loved movies and used to skip class to go to the nearby theater by myself, and with my lunch money I watched film after film,” she said.
Piersanti’s professional relationship with Guadagnino stretches back to 2015. After meeting in Milan through mutual friends, the Italian film director approached her to work on “A Bigger Splash,” starring Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes and Dakota Johnson. Impressed by Piersanti’s understanding of complex human social behaviors, Guadagnino felt she was a natural fit for the film’s costume design. But instead of leaping at the opportunity, “I was worried it would be too big of a responsibility,” Piersanti recalled. Back then, she had never worked on a project of that scale, and there was much to be done, but she remembered getting straight to work. “I got stressed out for time, so I started making phone calls and research,” she said.
The film turned out to be a critical success, garnering favorable reviews for its visually arresting style rather than just the acting or the plot. The costumes, particularly Swinton’s wardrobe and the pieces designed by Raf Simons during his tenure at Dior, were celebrated as a key element of the artistic narrative and established the movie as a source of style inspiration. Piersanti has since become a go-to collaborator for Guadagnino, working on the costumes for several of his films in the years that followed, including the critically acclaimed “Call Me by Your Name” and gorier “Bones and All” and “Suspiria.”
Each project or collection Piersanti works on requires thoughtful consideration as she juggles designing for the big screen and for everyday people — or at least, the customers who buy Celine clothes. “Creating looks for movies and designing for fashion are two very different things,” she stated, observing that while both draw from historical references, “most movies stay in the past or the present, to tell a story about a character. Fashion, on the other hand, is about the future.”
Nonetheless, both mediums challenge her creatively, Piersanti said. “They both need empathetic observation to understand people and why they dress in one way or another.” And while Piersanti often experienced “culture shock” due to moving around as a child, it ultimately “opened my mind to different worlds and realities, which has very much fed my work,” she added.
Guadagnino’s latest film presents messy characters navigating a 2019 landscape shortly after the rise of the #MeToo movement, which held men accountable for the sexual abuse and exploitation of women, and a time of heightened debate around cancel culture and social justice. Unlike his past projects, there is little exploration of sexuality or love; instead, the focus of the movie is on power dynamics and optics.
Piersanti said she used the script as the starting point. Typically, at the beginning of any film’s production, Guadagnino “will talk me through the characters and what he wants to say about them,” she explained. From there, she’ll have carte blanche on the clothes. Piersanti’s process then unfolds through visual research, which she’ll plaster on the walls of the costume department, “so that when the actors come in for fittings, they are surrounded by visuals of what their characters will look like,” she said.
Beyond what a person might wear, Piersanti said she thinks about “their psychology” including “what they might like and what music they might listen to.” The goal, she continued, is to ensure the viewer “understands the character without making too obvious choices but still adding personality where the script allows freedom.”
For “After the Hunt” in particular, Piersanti watched the 1988 American drama “Another Woman” starring Gena Rowland (who also plays a professor) for inspiration in creating a “higher bourgeoisie mood,” she said. Primarily, Piersanti wanted to convey “upper-class chic,” with a touch of “edge and rigidity.” As she noted: “No soft fabrics, no knitwear, no dresses.”
That resulted in much of the cast wearing blazers, trousers and loafers — anything that could create an angular feel. Though, it was a different approach for Alma’s psychologist husband, whose clothing inspiration was “less new England academics,” according to Piersanti, and more in the style of music composer Philip Glass and the late filmmaker David Lynch and “how they wear lightweight Japanese suits with no ties.”
It is these finer details that act as a prescient form of non-verbal communication, which excites Piersanti most. Some naysayers may dismiss fashion as frivolous or an unessential part of daily life, but for Piersanti, that couldn’t be further from the truth. “Everyone makes choices, whether consciously or subconsciously, when choosing what they wear or buy,” she said. “To understand that allows me to design for a customer who will buy the garment and for a character in the script.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/business/tesla-investigation-self-driving-intl,"Tesla under investigation after cars with the self-driving feature ran red lights, drove on the wrong side of the road",,,,CNN,"US federal regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla’s self-driving feature after dozens of incidents in which the cars ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday that it is looking into 58 incidents in which Teslas reportedly violated traffic safety laws while using the company’s so-called Full Self-Driving mode, leading to more than a dozen crashes and fires and nearly two dozen injuries.
The new probe adds to several other open investigations into Tesla technology that could upend Elon Musk’s plans to turn millions of his cars already on the road into completely driverless vehicles with an over-the-air update to their software.
“The ultimate question is, ‘Does the software work?’” asked Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst with a “sell” rating on the stock. Added money manager Ross Gerber, “The world has become a giant testing ground for Elon’s concept of full self-driving, and it’s not working,”
The probe comes as Musk, whose fortune as the world’s richest man derives partly from Tesla’s levitating stock, has promised to roll out hundreds of thousands of driverless taxis in cities around the United States by the end of next year.
The new investigation covers 2.9 million vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, a misnomer criticized for lulling drivers into handing full control over to their cars. Tesla has argued to regulators and in court cases that it has repeatedly told drivers the system cannot drive the cars by itself and whoever is behind the wheel must be ready to intervene at all times.
In the new probe, regulators reported that many of the Tesla drivers involved in accidents said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.
Tesla ( TSLA ) stock fell nearly 3% at one point Thursday but closed with a loss of just 0.7%.
The agency behind the latest probe, NHTSA, opened an investigation last year into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed. NHTSA also opened an investigation earlier this year for a “summon” technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up after reports of several fender benders in parking lots.
Another investigation was launched by the agency in August looking into why Tesla apparently has not been reporting crashes promptly as required.
Tesla is facing a new federal investigation into its autonomous driving features
That same month, a Miami jury found that Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology — which is different than full self-driving — and must pay the victims more than $240 million in damages. Tesla said it would appeal the decision.
Money manager Gerber, a long-time Tesla investor who says he once was a big believer in the company’s driver assistance feature, says the company should stop calling it full self-driving and admit the vision-only system using cameras on its cars needs to be supplemented with radar sensors and other hardware. Otherwise, regulators should force it to do that.
“They have to take responsibility for the fact that the software doesn’t work right and either adjust the hardware accordingly — and Elon can just deal with his ego issues — or somebody is gonna have to come in and say, ‘Hey, you keep causing accidents with this stuff and maybe you should just put it on test tracks until it works,’” he said.
The FSD system under investigation is what is called Level 2 driver-assistance software that requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. A new version of FSD was introduced earlier this week. The company is also testing a vastly upgraded version that does not require driver intervention, something that Musk has been promising to roll out for years.
Tesla is under pressure to show success with FSD because the main part of its business — selling cars — is struggling.
Customers who don’t like Musk’s support of President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe have boycotted the company, sinking sales. Meanwhile, rival electric vehicle makers, including China’s BYD, are stealing market share with cheaper, high-quality offerings.
In response, Musk on Tuesday announced Tesla would be selling two new, stripped-down and cheaper versions of models already on the road, including its best-selling Model Y. But investors, hoping for lower prices or a completely new offering, were unimpressed, pushing the stock down 4.5%."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/europe/russia-ukraine-infrastructure-attack-hnk-intl,Ukraine says ‘massive’ Russian attack targeted energy infrastructure,,,,CNN,"Russia carried out a “massive attack” on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, top Ukrainian officials said early Friday, killing at least one person and leaving parts of the capital Kyiv without power.
The Kremlin appears again to be using a tactic deployed in previous years, depriving Ukrainians of power and heat ahead of the bitter winter months. Russia started attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in late September, according to official reports and CNN’s assessment.
The attacks have been almost daily since then, with targets including energy generating facilities, including gas production and distribution.
Russia’s Ministry of Defense said in a Telegram statement Friday that it had launched a “massive” strike targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, in what it said was a response to “the terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime on civilian targets on Russian territory.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Friday’s strike “a cynical and calculated attack, with more than 450 drones and over 30 missiles targeting everything that sustains normal life, everything the Russians want to deprive us of.”
“It is precisely the civilian and energy infrastructure that is the main target of Russia’s strikes ahead of the heating season,” he added.
It is Russia’s “goal to leave us in darkness, without water and heat,” said the Kyiv region’s governor, Mykola Kalashnik, adding that about 28,000 families in the Brovary and Boryspil districts were without power.
Power outages also affected more than 16,500 households and 800 businesses in the Poltava region, its governor Volodymyr Kogut said.
A 7-year-old boy was killed in a strike on the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, and dozens more injured, according to foreign minister Andriy Sybiha.
Local authorities say at least 33 people have been injured overall across the Cherkasy, Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia regions.
“In Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and other regions, many people remain without power following Russian strikes on civilian energy objects,” Sybiha said.
Workers were taking “all necessary measures to minimize the negative consequences,” Ukraine’s energy minister Svitlana Grynchuk said in a statement Friday.
At least 12 people were injured in Kyiv during Friday’s attack, which had cut some power supplies, said the city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko.
He said that the left bank of the capital was without power, with the city also reporting water supply issues.
Mykyta Varenya, a 26-year-old coffee shop owner from Kyiv, told CNN he had resorted to using a generator after the latest strikes. “The lights were out, there was no water, so I’m just getting by with a generator,” he said.
“Last year, it had a big impact (on my business). We had problems with the generator at first, gasoline is expensive, and roughly speaking, you end up breaking even, or even losing money with these outages.”
Pensioner Olena, 68, who only gave her first name, was one of the citizens who had queued up at a local shop to buy water after running water in her property was cut on Friday morning.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/ice-videos-dhs-noem-immigration-arrests-analysis,DHS leans into propaganda with militaristic action videos,,,,CNN,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .
When helicopters descended on a Chicago apartment building last week with federal agents kitted out in military gear, locals saw a terrifying escalation in the federal government’s incursion into Chicago.
Department of Homeland Security officials saw a cinematic opportunity for a “ Call of Duty”-style recruiting video with images from helmet cameras and dramatic music.
Flush with money from Republicans in Congress and on a hiring spree, Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs to recruit a lot of people.
It also wants to send a message to immigrants, as it did with a more traditional international ad campaign earlier this year. The message is stay out of the US and leave if you’re here.
From the DHS side of the camera lens, there are videos like the one with the hunting or military-style tag line “ Bag it. Tag it. Take it down,.”
The behind-the-scenes versions are on CCTV, like this post from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute immigration expert David Bier, a critic of the administration, that shows agents, with a masked photographer in tow, sprinting after unidentified men who had been drinking coffee on the corner.
These videos borrow from the wartime Uncle Sam posters of yore to call for recruits as it has relaxed standards , waiving age requirements and offering a $50,000 signing bonus to bring in new people. And its videos might be intended to entice a certain type of young adult into the federal service.
At the same time, the underlying events behind the videos today could be traumatizing kids, including US citizens, who find themselves on the business end of raids.
“Imagine being a child wakened in the middle of the night by a Blackhawk helicopter on your roof,” said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker at a news conference on Tuesday, as he complained about federal agents arriving with camera crews in tow.
The videos also dovetail with a long line of US government wartime propaganda efforts, albeit with a harder edge than Rosie the Riveter. During World War II, the Hollywood director Frank Capra produced a series of “ Why We Fight ” films in order to boost morale and instill loyalty.
The DHS videos, by contrast, are focused on action inside the US instead of protecting the country from foreign threats.
The videos also make questions about deploying the National Guard in US cities beside the point. There’s already a militarized force on the ground.
CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said there is nothing strange about law enforcement recording their activities. Some jurisdictions in fact require the use of body cams. But these videos are different, she said.
“They do not look like police videos,” said Kayyem, who was assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs during the Obama administration. “They look like campaign ones.”
Rather than serve a policing purpose, Kayyem said, the videos seem more designed to “scare communities, pretend like they are fighting a dangerous threat, or, as I suspect, to be used in GOP campaigns.”
DHS doesn’t just post action movie-style content. It also trolls critics who don’t like the image of masked agents arresting people without warrants in American streets.
When the country singer Zach Bryan published a snippet of a song that seemed to criticize ICE for kicking down people’s doors with the tag line, “the fading of the Red White and Blue,” DHS clapped back at the US Navy veteran by using another one of his songs, “All Night Revival,” as the soundtrack for a montage of its raids.
Bryan has since clarified that he falls on neither of the “radical sides” of the political aisle.
“Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are,” he said in an Instagram story. “We need to find our way back.”
The DHS social media effort is hip to the social media age, loaded up with guns, “Cops”-style arrests , fit-looking agents in combat gear, and knowing jokes.
One video took out of a context a comment by the comedian and manosphere podcaster Theo Von, who was recorded by a fan saying, “Heard you got deported dude, bye.”
That snippet was used by DHS as the punchline of another video. In his own social media post, Von asked the government to take it down.
“Please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos,” Von said on X. “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”
Surely the Von controversy only got more eyeballs on the video. A video featuring hard-hitting arrests over the Pokémon theme also got attention. The US government did not seek permission to use the theme, according to Pokémon.
The videos make use of the conservative media ecosystem by tapping influencers for ridealongs.
One recent video shared by the conservative content creator Benny Johnson showed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, apparently talking to a man she identified as a pedophile, driving home the government allegation that they are first targeting criminals for deportation.
But the man being arrested was not identified, making it impossible to verify the story.
When DHS posted a release identifying the “worst of the worst” of the undocumented immigrants arrested in Portland, alleging they were hardened criminals and pedophiles, some of the names did not have Oregon or federal cases associated with their names. Others had recently been in prison, serving sentences.
DHS did not respond to a request for comment.
Their allegations about detainees must be verified, however — especially after allegations about Kilmar Abrego Garcia , the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador for a time earlier this year, turned out to be overstated.
Abrego Garcia is back in the US and the government has charged him with human smuggling, a charge a federal judge said recently may have been brought out of vindictiveness .
Abrego Garcia was initially taken to a supermax prison in El Salvador, a place that seems designed to go viral for its harshness, as CNN’s David Culver documented .
The initial transfer of deportees to that prison was the subject of multiple US government videos.
Noem is a frequent star of government deportation videos, including a trip to the El Salvador prison, after which critics accused her of playing to cameras.
Another star of DHS videos is Gregory Bovino, the border patrol chief leading efforts on the ground in Chicago.
During an interview for a recent profile , CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez asked him about the videos and social media strategy. Bovino argued they are “so real life they appear to be Hollywood.”
The full exchange is interesting:
ALVAREZ: What is the message you want people to take from the videos and your general presence on, for example, X?
BOVINO: Transparency. Uh, I think the public sometimes doesn’t get transparency. We can go back to that reporter that misquoted me. That wasn’t transparent. That was agenda-driven. This is not agenda-driven. Our social media is designed to give the public a snapshot, a real-time snapshot of what is really happening, whether it’s on the border, or now in Los Angeles and or Chicago, what’s really happening. So they can take a look at that social media, those social media pages, and they’re getting an accurate snapshot of what’s happening. Now you might say, “Hey, that’s Hollywood. That looks like Hollywood.” Well, you know …
ALVAREZ: It’s highly produced.
BOVINO: Well, you know, it’s actually produced — there are Border Patrol agents that produce that. Those are border patrol agents that have learned their craft. Border Patrol agents right off the line  — and they learn their craft — that are producing those, but you think it’s a Hollywood video?  That’s real life. It might be so real life that it appears to be Hollywood, but a lot of that is real time.
The country, meanwhile, remains divided on the administration’s deportation efforts and tactics. A New York Times/Siena poll released this week found a majority of the country, led by Republicans, favors deporting those here illegally. At the same time, a similar majority thinks the process has been unfair."

It’s a notable departure from standard practice, as TSA checkpoint videos rarely feature political commentary.
Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.
The government shutdown is expected to extend into next week after the Senate again failed Thursday to advance rival Democratic and Republican stopgap spending bills. No further votes are expected until Tuesday, prolonging job uncertainty for thousands of federal workers. President Donald Trump on Thursday also vowed to target “Democrat programs” for cuts if the shutdown continues. “We’ll be making cuts that will be permanent, and we’re only going to cut Democrat programs,” he said during a Cabinet meeting. “They wanted to do this, so we’ll give them a little taste of their own medicine,” he added. Trump did not specify which programs he planned to target for cuts.
The Israeli military said today that a ceasefire was now in effect in Gaza , as its forces pull back in accordance with the deal approved by the government overnight. The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson added, however, that “troops will continue to be present in various areas of the Gaza Strip.” This comes after Israeli warplanes launched intense airstrikes in the center of Khan Younis, southern Gaza, earlier today. Eyewitnesses also described to CNN airstrikes and artillery shelling in Gaza City hours ago. At the same time, anticipation is building for the return of the hostages , which President Trump said could happen on Monday or Tuesday.
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded today to María Corina Machado for “promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.” Machado is a leader of the democracy movement in Venezuela , which has campaigned for free elections and representative government. Announcing the award, the Nobel Committee said Machado’s role as a “unifying figure” in Venezuela’s opposition movement “is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy: our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule, even though we disagree.” Machado went into hiding after the Venezuelan government moved to crush dissent following last year’s election. It is unclear whether she will be able to attend the prize ceremony in Norway in December.
Letitia James, the New York attorney general who defeated Trump in court, was indicted Thursday by the Justice Department. The charges stem from a mortgage fraud investigation and come as President Trump continues to call for his enemies to be prosecuted in court. James’ relationship with Trump has been adversarial for years as James campaigned on promises to investigate Trump and ultimately won a civil fraud case against him, his adult sons and his real estate business. A judge found them liable for fraud for inflating the value of their properties and ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties. A New York appeals court tossed the penalties and Trump has appealed the verdict.
A 7.4 magnitude earthquake rattled the southeastern coast of the Philippines earlier today, sending panicked residents running into the streets. Dramatic video showed residents on Mindanao island rushing out of buildings or trying to maintain their balance as the ground beneath them shook violently . The country is still recovering from a 6.9 magnitude quake that struck off the central island of Cebu less than two weeks ago. It was the Philippines’ deadliest in over a decade, killing at least 72 people, injuring hundreds and causing extensive damage.

Famously known as Sister Jean , she became a good luck charm for the Ramblers basketball team after reaching TV fame in 2018 when cameras showed her pre-game prayer and her cheering from the sidelines as the team went on a Cinderella run at the NCAA tournament.
Sister Jean, the 101-year-old basketball-loving nun, on praying for her favorite team
“In many roles at Loyola over the course of more than 60 years, Sister Jean was an invaluable source of wisdom and grace for generations of students, faculty, and staff,” Loyola President Mark C. Reed said in a statement.
“While we feel grief and a sense of loss, there is great joy in her legacy. Her presence was a profound blessing for our entire community and her spirit abides in thousands of lives. In her honor, we can aspire to share with others the love and compassion Sister Jean shared with us.”
Sister Jean was born Dolores Bertha Schmidt on August 21, 1919, before taking the name Sister Jean Dolores in 1937.
She started teaching at Mundelein College in Chicago in 1961 before the school merged with Loyola in 1991.
In 1994, she started as the school’s chaplain before becoming a viral sensation during the 2018 men’s NCAA basketball tournament.
The Ramblers went on to reach the Final Four, before losing to the University of Michigan.
When the program secured a spot in the 2021 men’s NCAA tournament , Sister Jean got the green light to go cheer on her squad in Indianapolis, Indiana after getting fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
The Ramblers March Madness magic continued that year, upsetting the No. 1 seeded Illinois Fighting Illini to advance to the Sweet 16.

Sister Jean retired in August from her duties at the university due to health concerns, though she reportedly remained an adviser in the final months of her life.
When CNN’s Coy Wire interviewed Sister Jean during the 2018 postseason, he told the basketball icon she was a celebrity.
“I know,” she replied. “That’s what they tell me. You probably know, I corrected the reporter the other day. She said, ‘You’re national.’ I said, ‘No, we’re international.’”
In 2023, at the age of 103, Sister Jean published a memoir called,“Wake Up with Purpose: What I’ve Learned in My First 100 Years,” detailing her journey through life and spiritually.
According to the school, Sister Jean is survived by her sister-in-law, Jeanne Tidwell, and her niece, Jan Schmidt.
Visitation and funeral arrangements will be announced by the university shortly.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/weather/hurricane-priscilla-moisture-southwest-flooding-rain-climate,Former Hurricane Priscilla is helping to create a notable flood threat in the Southwest,,,,CNN,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is no longer being updated. Click here for the latest forecast.
A serious flood threat is on tap for some of the driest areas of the United States as an ailing former Hurricane Priscilla combines with another storm system to create a long-lasting rainfall event.
More than an October’s worth of rain could fall within days in some areas of the Southwest and cause “potentially widespread flash flooding” and “significant impacts” as the week comes to a close, according to the Weather Prediction Center. And another tropical system following on the heels of Priscilla early next week could pile onto the flood threat.
Periods of rainfall will likely begin to increase Thursday, but the flood threat really increases Friday. A Level 3 of 4 threat of flooding rainfall is in place for Friday into early Saturday across central and northeastern Arizona, including Flagstaff, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
Serious flooding like what happened in 2018 because of a similar forecast instigated by remnants of Hurricane Rosa could happen in these areas, the WPC said. Numerous water rescues unfolded in Phoenix then after 2.36 inches of rain fell there during a single day, the city’s wettest October day on record.
The heightened flood risk will continue during the day Saturday, with a Level 2 of 4 flood threat in parts of Arizona, northwest New Mexico, southeast Utah and southwest Colorado.
Rainfall totals could be more than the entire October average in some areas. It’s possible Phoenix doubles its average October rain of just over a half-inch in a day or two. Flagstaff would need an inch and a half of rain to meet its average for the month.
The higher elevations of northern Arizona are likely to see the heaviest totals, possibly up to 3 or 4 inches.
That might not sound like much, but it can create serious problems in the desert where water runs off the dry ground quickly, especially if it falls fast enough. About 2 inches of rain fell in 30 minutes in Globe, Arizona, late last month, sending a torrent of water into downtown that swept cars away, damaged buildings and killed three people.
Washes, small streams and creeks and slot canyons could fill with rushing water and some could flood outside their banks during this event, so it’s best to avoid these areas. Recent wildfire burn scars could also see flooding and debris flows.
Most flood deaths occur on flooded roadways, since just 12 inches of water can float a car away.

It’s all happening in part because Priscilla, now a tropical storm, will juice up the atmosphere over the Southwest US with near-record levels of moisture for this time of year.
Think of the amount of moisture in the atmosphere like the amount of water in a sponge. The more there is, the more that can be wrung out by storms.
Priscilla is expected to dissipate later Thursday to the west of Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula. However, its moisture-rich air will get scooped up by a weather system riding through a dip in the jet stream along the West Coast.
This is a classic weather pattern that has historically been responsible for slingshotting Eastern Pacific hurricane remnants into the Southwest US where they can trigger flooding rain.
Phoenix is coming off its 10th-wettest September after picking up 2.26 inches of rain, or nearly quadruple the month’s average. Much of that fell during the same storm system that caused the deadly flooding in Globe. Despite the recent drenching, the Valley of the Sun remains in severe to extreme drought.
This might not be the end of the tropically-infused wet Southwest pattern either. Another Eastern Pacific tropical system could bring a new burst of drenching rain Sunday into Monday.
The heaviest rain from this second round might fall a bit farther east from southeast Arizona, including Tucson, into New Mexico, but details are still uncertain."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/climate/methane-seeps-antarctica,Scientists discover methane leaking out from beneath the ocean around Antarctica,,,,CNN,"Planet-heating methane is escaping from cracks in the Antarctic seabed as the region warms, with new seeps being discovered at an “astonishing rate,” scientists have found, raising fears that future global warming predictions may have been underestimated.
Huge amounts of methane lie in reservoirs that have formed over millennia beneath the seafloor around the world. This invisible, climate-polluting gas can escape into the water through fissures in the sea floor, often revealing itself with a stream of bubbles weaving their way up to the ocean surface.
Relatively little is known about these underwater seeps, how they work, how many there are, and how much methane reaches the atmosphere versus how much is eaten by methane-munching microbes living beneath the ocean.
But scientists are keen to better understand them, as this super-polluting gas traps around 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere.
Methane seeps in Antarctica are among the least understood on the planet, so a team of international scientists set out to find them. They used a combination of ship-based acoustic surveys, remotely operated vehicles and divers to sample a range of sites in the Ross Sea, a bay in Antarctica’s Southern Ocean, at depths between 16 and 790 feet.
What they found surprised them. They identified more than 40 methane seeps in the shallow water of the Ross Sea, according to the study published this month in Nature Communications.
Many of the seeps were found at sites that had been repeatedly studied before, suggesting they were new. This may indicate a “fundamental shift” in the methane released in the region, according to the report.
Methane seeps are relatively common globally, but previously there was only one confirmed active seep in the Antarctic, said Sarah Seabrook, a report author and a marine scientist at Earth Sciences New Zealand, a research organization. “Something that was thought to be rare is now seemingly becoming widespread,” she told CNN.
Every seep they discovered was accompanied by an “immediate excitement” that was “quickly replaced with anxiety and concern,” Seabrook said.
The fear is these seeps could rapidly transfer methane into the atmosphere, making them a source of planet-heating pollution that is not currently factored into future climate change predictions.
The scientists are also concerned the methane could have cascading impacts on marine life.
It’s unclear why the methane seeps are happening in the region, but the researchers are investigating whether they might be affected by climate change.
At the other end of the world, in the Arctic, increased underground methane release has been linked to climate change impacts, Seabrook said, including warmer temperatures, shifts in sea level and the continued, slow rise of land after the glaciers melted in the last Ice Age.
It can create a feedback loop, Seabrook added, where climate change increases methane seeps, which themselves further increase the rate of climate change.
The scientists are heading back to Antarctica next week for two months to analyze the seeps in more detail.
First methane-powered sea spiders found crawling on the ocean floor
Methane is a “real unknown, it’s going up in the atmosphere and we don’t know why,” said Andrew Thurber, a marine biology professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a study author.
One of the most significant concerns is what’s happening in Antarctica, where there are vast reservoirs of methane, Thurber told CNN. If humans continue to warm the planet, these seeps could go from “a natural laboratory to an epicenter of danger,” he said.
In some ways they “are like a dangerous animal,” he added. “They are amazing to study and understand, but one needs to be very aware of what they can do if provoked or underestimated.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/fema-security-grant-muslim-groups-trump,Exclusive: Inside the Trump administration’s efforts to disqualify Muslim groups from security grants,,,,CNN,"Top brass at the Department of Homeland Security approached the Federal Emergency Management Agency this spring with a proposal: What if the agency blocked millions of dollars in security grants awarded to Muslim organizations around the country?
The suggestion of a blanket ban left the FEMA leaders bewildered and deeply concerned, and they immediately pointed out such a proposal could be considered discriminatory and even illegal, according to three sources with knowledge of the episode who asked not to be named out of fear of reprisal.
While the DHS officials didn’t give a reason for disqualifying Muslim groups when they floated the idea, the Trump administration at the time was in the throes of dramatically downsizing the federal government.
Ultimately, the idea was dropped.
But six months later, dozens of those Muslim organizations     have been stripped of their eligibility for security funds that help protect against hate crimes and extremist attacks after DHS and the Department of Government Efficiency alleged that the groups have ties to terrorism.
Five FEMA insiders — including those with knowledge of the proposal to block the funds — describe those allegations as questionable, given the standard vetting the groups undergo     and the unusual circumstances that led to their loss of funding. Some suggested that the allegations of terror ties, which they said came with little evidence, may be a pretext to justify the cuts.
DHS, which oversees FEMA, denied to CNN that the department ever considered imposing a blanket ban on Muslim organizations receiving these security grants.
“DHS and FEMA do not make policy decisions on the basis of religion,” a DHS  spokesperson wrote in a statement. “Such claims are ludicrous and deeply unserious.”
The spokesperson said FEMA has been conducting an internal review of its grant recipients for months and has terminated funding to select groups found to have links to “terrorism or terrorist activities.”
But sources who spoke to CNN say the efforts to block funds from Muslim organizations raise questions about equal treatment in federal grant programs and demonstrate the disproportionate impacts that the sometimes-chaotic attempts to reshape the US government can have.
Several Muslim organizations contacted by CNN flatly denied any links to terrorist groups, suggesting they were singled out for political reasons.
The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) said its FEMA security grant was abruptly rejected this summer with no explanation. Sources and internal documents obtained by CNN reveal that, behind the scenes, DOGE spearheaded efforts to block funding from dozens of groups — including ISNA — citing ties to terrorism.
“We absolutely deny these allegations,” ISNA Executive Director Basharat Saleem told CNN. “This type of baseless information is very detrimental for civil society and for organizations that are doing good work.”
At the center of the dispute is FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which provides funding for security upgrades such as surveillance cameras, bulletproof glass and security guards to thousands of nonprofit organizations, most of them religious institutions considered more vulnerable to hate crime attacks.
In 2024, Congress injected an additional $400 million into the program amid a surge in both antisemitism and Islamophobia fueled by division over the ongoing war in Gaza. The funds were aimed at bolstering protections specifically for Jewish and Muslim institutions like synagogues, mosques, community groups and cultural centers.
After Trump took office, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered FEMA to pause almost all of the agency’s grants, including these security grants, for officials from DHS and DOGE to carry out a sweeping “manual review” of the spending. FEMA grant funds totaling billions of dollars were effectively frozen as a result.
By Spring, officials from DOGE and DHS were in discussions with FEMA leaders about unlocking the security grants, the three sources    told CNN. The administration was facing pressure from outside lobbying groups to expedite the release of funds to Jewish nonprofits, multiple sources said.
However, resuming the program would have potentially awarded money to Muslim organizations as well.
So, in April,   senior officials at DHS asked FEMA leadership how Muslim groups could be disqualified from receiving the funds, the sources told CNN.
“I think they were worried about the optics of giving money to Muslim organizations,” one of the sources who heard the proposal firsthand told CNN, adding that a blanket ban would be “totally illegal and improper.”
The FEMA leaders emphasized to DHS officials that the organizations had already been vetted and approved and should not lose their eligibility and potentially millions of dollars in funding.
The conversations seemed to fizzle as FEMA leaders pushed back, warning DHS officials that a blanket ban of Muslim groups could cause significant legal and public blowback, the sources said.
As the conversations were taking place and these grants were paused, thousands of nonprofits representing a wide range of faith groups – not just Muslim organizations – were waiting for the security funds to be approved, two of the sources told CNN.
Among them: the Capital Jewish Museum   in Washington, DC, where a gunman killed a young Jewish couple in May in what authorities called an antisemitic attack.
In late Spring, some of the funds were unlocked. DHS announced the first batch of nonprofit national security grants for 512 Jewish organizations in June, which included the Capital Jewish Museum, a source told CNN. No Muslim nonprofits were included in the announcement.
Around this time, scores of Muslim organizations, at DOGE’s direction, were quietly disqualified from the program.
DOGE officials embedded inside DHS claimed to have intelligence indicating that more than 100 of these previously approved organizations had ties to terrorist groups, according to sources and documents reviewed by CNN. The officials   said the intel came from someone outside the agency but didn’t specify the origin.
The White House, which oversees DOGE, referred CNN’s request for comment to FEMA.
Again, officials inside FEMA were alarmed by the orders, saying they saw no clear evidence linking the nonprofits to terrorist entities. One source, a long-time FEMA official, questioned the unspecified outside intelligence cited by DOGE.
“Everything about it seemed wrong,” the official said. “This felt like a manufactured narrative designed to justify excluding Muslim organizations from funding. What had always been an apolitical, risk-based grant process suddenly looked politicized in a way we’d never seen before.”
The person said they had never witnessed government agencies taking “an overt action or effort to implement a blanket prohibition like we saw earlier this year” against Muslim groups — not even after 9/11, when they felt “‘Islamophobia’ was at an all-time high.”
In a statement to CNN last week, DHS confirmed that it stripped funding from certain organizations, saying it did so after an internal review uncovered links to terrorism.
A spokesperson said FEMA used “resources including the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and law enforcement” to determine that “multiple grant subrecipients had supported or were affiliated with organizations or individuals associated with terrorism or terrorist activities.”
DHS said the department has improved its vetting process but declined to provide a full list of groups that lost eligibility and did not specify what new information led to their disqualification.
The department did not respond to questions about DOGE’s involvement.
The longtime FEMA official cast doubt on the validity of the department’s internal review given that previous administrations didn’t flag these organizations, some of which had received funds for years.
“How did they not catch this during the first Trump administration?” the official asked. “The real question is, what has changed to prevent these types of organizations from being approved again?”
Around the time that Muslim nonprofits were stripped of their grants, an outside group – the right-wing think tank Middle East Forum – also raised allegations about terrorist ties.
The forum published a lengthy report claiming DHS and FEMA have been distributing millions of dollars each year to dozens of Muslim organizations with alleged ideological and monetary ties to al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The pro-Israel Middle East Forum has been criticized by various groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center and Center for American Progress. Some have accused it of spreading anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian views, and of backing policies that unfairly target Muslim communities in the name of national security.
Defenders  argue that its efforts are aimed at confronting extremist political Islam, not the religion.
After the report’s publication, DOGE circulated it to FEMA staff, instructing them to ensure that none of the nonprofits named would receive funding, according to two sources.
Once again, FEMA leaders were concerned, questioning the so-called evidence in the report. “If you read the report, it’s rather shallow on facts,” a former high-ranking FEMA official said.
In July, a DHS spokesperson sent CNN a statement touting the department’s effort to withhold funding from “groups with questionable ties.” When CNN asked for specifics, the spokesperson pointed to the Middle East Forum report and a Fox News story that claimed DHS had cancelled dozens of grants in the wake of the think tank’s findings.
But now, DHS insists the think tank wasn’t involved in the department’s funding cuts. In an email last week, a spokesperson said FEMA staff have “methodically reviewed” grant recipients for months – “well before” the forum published its report.
Several organizations named in the Middle East Forum report have been under scrutiny for years, said Lorenzo Vidino, director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.
“I’m not suggesting that these are terrorist supporting organizations, but if they have questionable views and ties, I think that’s fair to say, and I think the bar of what entities the government should be supporting should be set higher,” Vidino said. “Some of the entities in the report are well-known, not just to the academic community, but to law enforcement, as being problematic.”
Still, Vidino added that each case should be considered individually, and that funding should be withdrawn only if there is clear evidence.
More than half a dozen groups named in the Middle East Forum report contacted by CNN denied the think tank’s allegations, pointing to what they described as the forum’s long history of Islamophobic rhetoric – a characterization the MEF disputes.
The Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center, which MEF claimed is “arguably one of the most prominent outposts for radical Islam in North America” said this was “a complete lie,” adding: “Whatever the hate that some people are spewing against Islam or the Muslim community, we cannot stop them.”
Criticisms of Dar Al-Hijrah date back more than a decade, when the Northern Virginia mosque was accused of hosting terrorists, including the 9/11 hijackers.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, labeled in the report as an “extremist group” with alleged ties to Hamas, pushed back forcefully against the report’s claims.
It also warned that if DHS is quietly blacklisting organizations without thoroughly vetting accusations — whether from DOGE, the Middle East Forum, or others — it marks a deeply troubling erosion of due process.
“The government cannot ban American Muslim nonprofit organizations from receiving federal grants because of their religious identity” or other political reasons, CAIR said in a statement to CNN. “Doing so places American Muslim institutions at increased risk during a time of rising hate.”
Middle East Forum, which responded to CNN after this story published, defended the report’s findings.
“The report speaks for itself,” Executive Director Gregg Roman said. “It is deeply sourced.”
Roman dismissed years of criticism aimed at the group, saying, “We have no issue with Islam whatsoever. Our issue is the juxtaposition of Islamist groups that are operating under the false banner of civil rights groups.”
He also insisted that MEF did not work with DOGE or DHS on the report, but said their goal was to shape government policy.
In August, Roman warned: “MEF is watching — whether the money is intended for foreign aid, public education, or homeland security — and we will not rest until every last cent allocated to terrorist-aligned groups is returned to American taxpayers.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/us/illinois-judge-ruling-ice-protests-pastor-chicago-hnk,Judge orders restrictions on federal tactics against ICE protesters after Chicago-area pastor shot with pepper balls,,,,CNN,"A judge in Illinois has temporarily blocked federal agents from using certain types of force and crowd-control measures against protesters, after video of a pastor being repeatedly shot by pepper balls during a demonstration outside at an ICE facility near Chicago drew widespread outcry.
A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order Thursday in the lawsuit filed Monday by the Chicago Headline Club, a nonprofit that represents journalists, alongside unions and individual protesters over federal law enforcement tactics.
The lawsuit alleges federal agents have shot, gassed, and detained individuals who have been protesting outside the ICE Detention Facility in Broadview for the last few weeks , preventing them from “exercising their First Amendment rights.” The suit also claims the tactics infringed journalists’ right to cover the protests.
Numerous videos have emerged of agents deploying tear gas , pepper balls and roughly throwing protesters to the ground during the demonstrations.
The judge’s order, which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from firing various types of less-lethal projectiles and chemical irritants and from “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual.”
Federal agents are more broadly prohibited from ordering a crowd to disperse or “requiring any person to leave a public place that they lawfully have a right to be.” There are exceptions for individuals who pose a threat to law enforcement or others.
The 14-day order took effect Thursday and applies to all DHS agents, including those with ICE and US Customs and Border Protection, in the district which encompasses Chicago and the Broadview ICE processing facility.
The judge also laid out specific protections for journalists covering the protests, blocking federal agents from arresting members of the press unless there is “probable cause to believe that the individual has committed a crime.”
A preliminary injunction hearing has been set for October 23, according to the federal court docket.
The order was issued on the same day that another judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard members in Illinois, one of several legal battles playing out over President Donald Trump’s push to send troops to Democrat-led cities.
The new ruling limiting use of force against protesters was issued in response to a complaint on behalf of multiple plaintiffs, including a Presbyterian pastor who was struck in the head by pepper balls while taking part in demonstrations at the Broadview facility last month.
Reverend David Black of Chicago’s First Presbyterian Church “stood in the street offering prayers” and urging ICE officers to repent, when he was repeatedly struck in the face by masked agents standing on top of the ICE facility, according to the lawsuit and video taken during the protest.
Black was “visibly attired in clerical garb” when “ICE snipers fired,” the lawsuit said. “Moments later he was doused with chemical spray that ICE agents directed at his face.”
Video obtained by CNN shows the pastor near the building with his arms outstretched when a cloud of smoke erupts from an explosion by his head, and he drops to the ground. Other protesters rushed to his aid and surrounded him. Another video shared with CNN shows masked agents pushing Black as he walks back and is then pepper sprayed in the face from close range.
In his first television interview since the incident, Black told CNN’s Erin’s Burnett a large group of federal officers then “rushed out of the gate and began to shove us,” describing their behavior was “indiscriminate” and “vicious.”
Black said federal officers dispensed “a huge amount of chemical weapons,” adding, “I was drenched from the crown of my head to the socks in my shoes.”
The Department of Homeland Security has defended the federal agents’ actions. Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the protestors had blocked an ICE vehicle from leaving the facility, ignored warnings and eventually began “throwing rocks, bottles and launching fireworks” at agents.
Black disputed McLaughlin’s claims, calling the account “categorically false.”
“There were no ICE vehicles attempting to leave the facility, and I was standing to the side in a gesture of prayer and praying verbally for the ICE officers and those detained inside,” he told Burnett.
The pastor insisted he and other protesters received “no warning” and claimed he could hear the agents laughing as they fired shots from the roof, calling it “deeply disturbing.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/federal-workers-paychecks-government-shutdown,Federal workers start to miss paychecks amid government shutdown,,,,CNN,"Knowing he’d have a hard time feeding his family of seven once his paychecks stopped coming, one Department of Veterans Affairs worker asked his local supermarket if it could cut him some slack on his grocery tab until the federal government reopens . The customer service staffer asked if he was kidding.
That day has arrived. The paycheck the worker receives Friday will be several hundred dollars lighter than usual, and it will be the last one he receives until a fractured Congress agrees on a spending package for the current fiscal year.
So the worker, who like all those CNN interviewed requested anonymity to protect their jobs, had no choice but to break the bad news to his children.
“We have told the kids they can’t have any snacks, and they are going to get smaller portions of food because we have to make it last,” said the employee, who is considered essential and must still report to work.
Roughly 1.4 million federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of the major agencies’ shutdown contingency plans.
They are now feeling the reality of the shutdown. Many are due this week to receive partial paychecks, compensating them only for the days they worked before the government shut down on October 1. Others will get smaller paychecks in coming days.
And they’ll all have to rely on other financial resources from here on until lawmakers act — which does not appear likely anytime soon.
It gets worse next week, as military personnel will miss their first paycheck on October 15. That has not happened in recent prior shutdowns, said Caleb Quakenbush, the center’s associate director of economic policy. In the past, Congress passed a measure to ensure most military members continued to be paid. But on Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson told GOP lawmakers in a private call that he would not put a standalone bill for military pay on the floor.
Military families brace for missed paychecks as shutdown impacts are already accumulating
Also in past shutdowns, government workers received back pay once the impasse ended. During the most recent prior impasse in 2018-2019, which lasted a record 35 days, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that assured that employees would be made whole.
During that shutdown, federal employees collectively had $9 billion in compensation delayed, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.
However, the White House threw into doubt this week whether furloughed staffers, who are sent home during shutdowns, would get back pay after the government reopens. A draft Office of Management and Budget memo suggested that furloughed employees need not get paid under the 2019 law, an interpretation that Trump doubled down on in remarks.
It’s not clear whether that view will prevail. Multiple Republican and Democratic lawmakers said if there was any uncertainty about the legality of back pay, Congress could fix the issue by adding language into the next spending bill.
One furloughed federal employee who works in public safety said that missing a paycheck or two would be catastrophic. Concerned that a shutdown was looming, he worked extra long hours in September to minimize the damage to this week’s paycheck, which he says will only be eight to 10 hours short. Still, he’s worried about how his family of four will cope financially until the government reopens.
“Even though it’s only eight to 10 hours, it matters,” he told CNN, noting he plans to find odd jobs to bring in at least a little money. “It means different groceries. It means, ‘Hey, is there a potential that we’re going to miss a couple bills or not’?”
Other federal employees interviewed said the shutdown could leave them without housing. One Bureau of Land Management worker told CNN he had been counting on his late October paycheck to cover the deposit for an apartment that his family of five is moving to after downsizing from a house. They can’t afford to stay in their expensive temporary rental for much longer, but he has been too scared to ask the new apartment manager if he could get a break on the deposit. He’s hoping the government shutdown ends within the next two weeks.
Likewise, a civilian employee of the Pentagon, who recently separated from her husband, is depending on her biweekly paycheck to pay for her new accommodation. Her paycheck on Friday will be $500, or 30%, smaller, which is already putting her in a bind.
“I am a paycheck and a half away from being unable to pay my rent,” she said. “Gas costs money. Food costs money. Utilities cost money. All of which I am not receiving currently.”
Several of the workers CNN interviewed reported mixed success in asking creditors for leniency during the shutdown.
The wife of one Department of Homeland Security employee told CNN she called her car loan company crying on the first day of the shutdown. The representative said the couple didn’t have to make another payment until December, and they wouldn’t be charged interest. But their mortgage company wouldn’t work with them, she said.
To get by, the couple took out an interest-free relief loan from USAA, a financial services company, to stock up on groceries for themselves and their two daughters, pay their car registrations and set a little aside for savings. But she is still worried about how they’ll get by on just her salary until the government reopens.
“I’m absolutely terrified of failing my kids and having to beg my family for help,” she said."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/sport/football-nfl-week-6-giants-eagles-intl,Giants rookies Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo combine for five touchdowns in historic New York win over Eagles,,,,CNN,"The rookie duo of Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo combined for five touchdowns to lift the New York Giants to a historic 34-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday Night Football .
Quarterback Dart, starting just his third NFL game after being selected with the 25th pick in the 2025 Draft, threw for a touchdown and ran in another, while Skattebo – picked in the fourth round in April – rushed for 98 yards and three scores.
With their performance, Dart and Skattebo hit multiple historic marks, as well as continuing to breathe new life into a Giants organization which has struggled for success in recent years.
The pair’s infectious positivity – highlighted by their joint celebrations and clips of them addressing the camera, punctuated with Skattebo’s now-famous scream – has already made them favorites among the New York fanbase.
After the victory over the defending champion Eagles, Skattebo spoke about the relationship he and Dart have built having been drafted to the Big Apple.
“Me and him do a lot of things on the side together, talk a lot together about kind of getting this turned around,” the 23-year-old told reporters. “Not doing it on our own, but getting everyone to buy in and continue to stay positive and work to be better.
“The franchise has been a losing franchise the last couple years, but that’s not who we are right now. We need to continue to build and build and build each and every day and have these guys with positive mindsets, and get away from that losing mindset. We won the game tonight, and I felt that through these guys.”
The Giants hadn’t beaten a reigning Super Bowl champion since 1998 so Thursday’s clash against the star-studded Eagles looked like a tall task on paper.
But New York raced into a 13-3 first quarter lead, Dart rushing 20 yards for the first TD of the game before connecting with Wan-Dale Robinson for a 35-yard score.
Philadelphia rallied though, with two long touchdown drives draining the energy out of MetLife Stadium as they took a 17-13 lead midway through the second quarter.
But from that point on, it was the Dart and Skattebo show as the Eagles failed to score another point.
Skattebo scored the next three touchdowns – each culminating with his now-famous backflip and surfing celebration – to send the energy levels among the New York fans in attendance through the roof as they caught a glimpse of what could be in the years to come with Dart and the hard-nosed running back in the backfield.
Skattebo became just the second Giants rookie ever – and the first since 2011 – to rack up three rushing scores in a game, according to the NFL .
By leading his new team to victory against the Eagles, Dart became the first Giants rookie starting QB since Travis Tidwell in 1950 to earn a win over their NFC East rival.
As a duo, Dart and Skattebo became the first two Giants rookies to tally rushing scores in the same game since Larry Heater and Leon Perry in Week 10 of the 1980 season against the Dallas Cowboys.
Dart finished the game with 195 passing yards on 17-of-25 attempts, as well as 13 carries for 58 yards. In doing so, he became third quarterback in the Super Bowl era with 50-or-more rushing yards in their first three starts, joining Eagles star Jalen Hurts and two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson.
“I’ve liked everything about Dart since we got him,” Giants head coach Brian Daboll said afterwards. “Again, he’s not perfect, it’s not gonna be perfect, whatever it may be.
“But you’ve got toughness. He sees the field well. You’ve got athleticism, vision, leadership. But it’s three games in, 2-1 as a starting quarterback. Got a lot to work on. He’ll be the first to tell you that, but he’s a leader.”
The Giants improve to 2-4 while for the Eagles, it’s a second straight loss as they fall to 4-2.
It was another worrying offensive performance for Philadelphia who, despite opening the season 4-0, have failed to consistently produce explosive offensive plays and get their star talent – notably, running back Saquon Barkly and receiver AJ Brown – involved."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/gaza-ceasefire-endgame-mcgurk-analysis,Beginning of the endgame in Gaza,,,,CNN,"Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
The news last night from Egypt brings hope for the first time in months to suffering hostage families, Israelis with loved ones on the front lines, and Gazans trapped in a tragic war that Hamas started. The deal requires the release of all remaining hostages living and remains held by Hamas and then a long process that aims to see Gaza recover with Hamas no longer in control of the Strip or its Palestinian population.
So, what should we make of this deal, and expect to see over the coming days?
Diplomacy is a lonely task. Former Sen. George Mitchell after negotiating the Good Friday Accords to end the Northern Ireland conflict described “700 days of failure and one day of success.” In my experience, far more so when the mission involves negotiations to free hostages and end a regional war that engulfed the Middle East after Hamas’s invasion of Israel two long years ago this week.
That is one reason the agreement reached last night on Gaza is a massive and unequivocal triumph.
This year began with some hope following agreement for a three-phase deal to release hostages and ultimately end the war. I helped negotiate that deal , with support from the incoming Trump administration, a rare example of bipartisan cooperation . But it fell apart in March, and the last six months have been some of the worst in the entire war.
How the Biden and Trump teams worked together to get the Gaza ceasefire and hostages deal done
Consider that as of only a few weeks ago, there were no talks ongoing. Israel had just launched its largest offensive of the war, and Qatar had backed out of its mediating role after an Israeli strike into its capital city targeting Hamas’s outside leadership.
France and the UK pursued their own initiatives to recognize a Palestinian state without asking anything from Hamas, the Palestinians, or Israelis. Hamas hailed that approach, and many in Congress at the same time lined up behind legislation to cut military aid to Israel.
Against that trend, the Trump administration offered its own framework that demanded Hamas release all hostages at once or else face “obliteration.” This plan requires Hamas to cede control in Gaza in favor of an interim security force and to decommission its weapons and for Israel to give up any claim to annex or occupy Gaza.
It also points to a conditions-based pathway to establish a Palestinian state well down the road.
The president and his team rallied unanimous regional and majority-Muslim state support behind this plan, helping to further isolate Hamas, while also pressuring Israel to accept its terms. Last Friday, the president threatened Hamas again with obliteration if it refused to accept the plan and then called on Israel to stop military strikes after Hamas responded with an equivocal yes.
This was good diplomacy backed by the application of power, incentives, and deadlines. And it appears to have worked.
Yes, this framework builds on what was developed in the Biden administration and intended to be Phase 2 of the January deal, but credit where it is due: Trump and his team, led by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, stood in the face of critics and events to forge a deal that saves lives and may end this awful war, together with a pathway towards longer term peace. That alone is an achievement worth celebrating.
Now, what should we expect over the coming days, and can the plan work as intended?
In the January deal, Hamas emerged from its underground fortress of tunnels, a labyrinth longer and more extensive than the Manhattan subway system, in full military gear, clean uniforms, and a demonstration of staying power as the only security force in Gaza. It paraded hostages and the coffin of an Israeli baby, taunting Israel into restarting the war and forfeiting any serious prospect for a second phase.
This time, the deal calls for Hamas to relinquish power and such grotesque displays and shows of force would be a clear violation of the accord.
One early sign of whether this promising deal can lead to a new beginning for Gazans without Hamas, is whether and how Hamas manages the release of the hostages.
If it looks like the January deal, that will be a bad sign, and Israel might be more inclined once its hostages are returned to renew the war. It is thus incumbent upon the countries with influence over Hamas, primarily Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, to ensure that implementation goes smoothly with handovers managed quietly and overseen by the International Committee for the Red Crescent / Red Cross (ICRC).
Hamas and what’s left of it as a military organization needs to stay out of view if the aim is to set conditions for a longer-term peace.
Phase Two of this new deal is basically all that happens after Hamas has returned the hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. The deal calls for establishment of an interim security force and an interim political structure in Gaza. None of that has yet been stood up, and doing so could take months absent steady US pressure and leadership.
In the Biden administration, US Central Command developed plans for an interim international security force inside Gaza. US forces would not be in Gaza but would provide logistical and other forms of support from Egypt and elsewhere.
These plans are likely being dusted off now, and several countries have reportedly offered forces for the interim security structure. But building such a security coalition also takes time, and in that time, Hamas will likely seek to reassert its authority, even if quietly though the intimidation of Gazans.
Thus, it’s critical that the US move rapidly to lock down troop commitments and establish the command structure and rules of engagement for this interim phase. Failure to do so might forfeit the promise of the present moment and increase risks of the war reigniting.
Similarly, the political entity outlined in the deal needs to be named, and there will be debate and controversy over every name to be included. Once again, only the US can impose discipline and help get these structures stood up fast.
Finally, the plan calls for an international backed and financed reconstruction program. This, too, requires leadership. Fortunately, the US knows how to do this. One example is Mosul, the Iraqi city that was nearly destroyed in the year-long battle to oust ISIS ten years ago. I recall standing in the rubble shortly after the battle and questioning whether the city might ever be rebuilt let alone recover.
But the US, through a global coalition, mustered the organization and the resources to begin the process and now ten years later, even the historic mosques and churches that were flattened in the battle have been restored .
See Mosul rebuilt after ISIS
The same process and more will be needed for Gaza and it should begin now together with a coalition of countries ready to contribute resources and expertise. For now, what is critical is to set all these processes in motion and not allow the spoilers including the remnants of Hamas to reconstitute and recover.
As one of the negotiators of the only two previous ceasefires of the Gaza war, I’ve gotten to know many of the hostage families and shared their suffering and in some cases grief over loved ones lost to Hamas. When first learning of the deal last night, these families were my first thought, and I have not stopped thinking of them since.
Twenty families this week will be reunited with loved ones who suffered over two years in the most horrific conditions imaginable, underground, chained, suffocating, darkness. Nearly 30 more will be reunited with the remains of loved ones, those killed by Hamas on October 7 and afterwards.
These innocent families and the hostages soon to return home deserve admiration and support long after this coming week.
It’s too early to conclude that this deal will lead to a more lasting peace. Much can go wrong, and Israel will have elections for a new government sometime over the coming year, which may divert focus from regional diplomacy.
But the potential is now there. On October 7 two years ago, Hamas intended to rally its partners in a multi-front war against Israel. For a time it succeeded, but those partners – Iran, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iraqi militias, and the Assad regime in Syria – have now one-by-one been defeated or significantly degraded. No doubt, this opens a historic opportunity for a broader peace and integration in the Middle East, and that will be a topic over the coming months.
But for now, let’s focus on these first halting steps and welcome the scenes of hostages coming out of Gaza – all of them – together with those of Gazans celebrating relief from the war Hamas started. It’s a day many believed would never come and one delivered by the old-fashioned art of persistent diplomacy."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/jared-kushner-trump-gaza-deal,Jared Kushner returns to forefront of Trump’s Middle East diplomacy with Gaza ceasefire deal,,,,CNN,"As President Donald Trump was predicting this week that peace could be imminent in Gaza, he pointed to the man he dispatched to seal the deal as a source for his optimism.
“I have Jared,” he said. “Find anybody more capable. And we have the A-plus team working on it.”
Jared, of course, is Jared Kushner : presidential son-in-law, onetime senior adviser and, this week, envoy to peace talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where — alongside Trump’s current Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff — he helped finalize an arrangement that would see all hostages released from Gaza and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops.
Trump spent hours on the phone with Kushner and Witkoff this week, both before and after he announced the deal had been reached, US officials said. From Egypt, the two men traveled to Israel, where they presented the plan to Israel’s Cabinet on Thursday evening before the body eventually approved it. The two men got a combined five hours of sleep from the time they left the United States, one senior US official said.
As the talks were getting underway on Wednesday, video from the Red Sea resort showed a grinning Kushner — clad in a navy blue suit, open-necked white shirt and black aviator sunglasses — emerging from a black SUV with Witkoff and heading into the talks.
It wasn’t until that evening that the negotiators arrived at what the senior official called “very serious breakthroughs” on the outstanding issues.
Plenty of details remain outstanding, including whether Hamas will disarm and what future governance of Gaza will look like. Kushner is expected to continue playing a very active role in the next phases of the negotiations, another White House official told CNN.
“There’s still, you know, just a lot of ways that this can go wrong,” another senior US official said Thursday evening in a phone call with reporters. “So we’re staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated, and we really want to make sure that we get to the withdrawal, we get to the cease fire, and then we get to a place where the hostages can return home, the exchange is done, and then we’ll go into the next phase, which is figuring out what comes next in Gaza.”
“We have a lot of concepts and ideas that we’ve been trying to get developed for a long time that now we’ll have to get operationalized and hopefully done. So this is a very delicate time,” the official said.
What we know and don’t know about Trump’s deal to end the war in Gaza
On Thursday, administration officials and Trump allies praised Kushner and Witkoff for getting the first phase of the deal across the finish line. One ally told CNN that Kushner was responsible for making many of the negotiators and leaders from Arab countries feel more comfortable with the negotiation process, given his close relationships in the region.
“I put Jared there because he’s a very smart person, and he knows the region, knows the people, knows a lot of the players,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting.
Before they left for Egypt, Witkoff and Kushner privately said they would not leave the region until they had an agreement to release hostages and end the war, a senior US official told CNN. Sources said the negotiating teams on the ground operated on very little sleep, sitting through hours of discussions and meetings to bridge final differences in the agreement.
Now, Trump is preparing to join his son-in-law and envoy in the region. He said he could travel within days to celebrate the agreement.
For Kushner, the envoy role represents a return to public global diplomacy after declining to take a formal role in Trump’s second administration. For months, he has operated mostly behind the scenes to informally advise administration officials on Middle East diplomacy and compile the 20-point plan that has emerged as the latest, best hope to resolve the conflict.
Kushner’s intention once the Gaza deal is finalized is to return to the same informal advising role he was carrying out in the first months of Trump’s second term.
His involvement has not been without controversy. Following the president’s 2020 election loss, Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump , moved to Miami and largely exited politics. Kushner founded an investment fund, Affinity Partners, shortly after leaving Washington with major backing from sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf — some of the very monarchies who are now heavily invested in the ongoing peace efforts.
In a deal last month, Kushner’s firm teamed up with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and other partners for a $55 billion deal to take the video-game maker Electronic Arts private , the largest leveraged buyout in history.
Jared Kushner’s firm and the Saudis are taking video game maker EA private in a massive deal
Affinity has also raised billions in capital from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, the latter of which has played a key mediating role in the ongoing efforts to end the Gaza war.
The set-up in many ways illustrates Trump’s preferred way of doing business in his second term: Rely on longtime confidants, many of them wealthy, to execute his objectives, give them broad operational leeway and mostly gloss over the ethical questions raised by their complex finances.
Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took umbrage when a reporter asked about Kushner’s parallel business and diplomatic dealings in the Middle East.
“I think it’s frankly despicable that you’re trying to suggest that it’s inappropriate for Jared Kushner, who is widely respected around the world and has great trust and relationships with these critical partners in these countries, to strike a 20-point comprehensive, detailed peace plan that no other administration would ever be able to achieve,” she said. “Jared is donating his energy and his time to our government, to the president of the United States, to secure world peace, and that is a very noble thing.”
Kushner has told the president and Witkoff that he views securing a peace deal between Israel and Hamas as something that “supersedes anything he has going on in the region,” a White House official told CNN.
“He has told me himself that the business stuff doesn’t matter as long as there’s a peace deal,” the official said, arguing that Kushner’s role in the negotiations could impact some of his business ties.
A person close to Kushner said that the president’s son-in-law “talks about legacy a lot.”
“He’ll often say he won’t be remembered for the business deals he made. He will be remembered for the peace deals,” this person said.
Few inside the Trump administration are surprised at Kushner’s role in the current talks, given his continued influence with the president. Kushner’s father Charles, a real estate developer, is Trump’s ambassador to France. A number of Trump’s nominees read Kushner’s 2022 book detailing some of his experience in Trump’s first term to understand the players and dynamics in the Middle East, sources said during the transition period last year.
Kushner and Witkoff — another real estate developer and longtime friend of Trump’s — have maintained a close personal relationship for years, sources told CNN. The two have been in regular contact since the president’s transition after last November’s election, often with Kushner offering advice to Witkoff on how to handle certain Arab leaders and relationships in the region.
Trump’s ‘lone ranger’: How Steve Witkoff became the de facto point man on America’s foreign policy challenges
“They bounce ideas off each other, they give each other advice — that has been happening since the beginning of this administration,” one White House official told CNN.
Witkoff has privately referred to Kushner as one of his “rabbis” when it comes to his efforts to drive a solution to the Gaza conflict, one source said.
“He has never really been gone,” said another source of Kushner’s engagement, noting frequent text exchanges with Witkoff throughout the last months and frequent meetings between the two men at the White House and in Miami.
White House officials told CNN there wasn’t a specific point in the president’s second term when Kushner got heavily involved in the talks to end the war in the Middle East. Instead, they argued he has always played a critical role — albeit a quiet, more behind the scenes one — in negotiations.
“Even on the campaign trail, Jared had a heavy presence. He’s never not been in the fold, particularly on matters related to the Middle East and the war,” one of the officials said.
Kushner is among a small handful of people who “speak on behalf of the president with the authority of the president of the United States,” said David Schenker, who served as assistant secretary of state for Middle East issues during Trump’s first term.
“Jared’s involvement was a positive indication of the administration’s investment in this process,” he told CNN.
Schenker noted that although they have reached a phase one deal, “the second phase, the next 15 points or so of the plan, are really the challenging part, and what will require intensive, high-level engagement from Washington and pressure to push this through.”
“Jared is the administration’s sort of ‘Mighty Mouse’ on this,” he said.
Kushner quietly began working with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair almost a year ago on developing a post-war plan for Gaza, building on a relationship between the two men going back to the first Trump administration, two sources said.
Blair and Kushner, who had met multiple times at the White House during the first Trump administration, spoke with regional players for input. They both attended an August meeting in the Oval Office with Trump to discuss the framework.
But it was the Israeli strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha on September 9 that jumpstarted the discussions that are unfolding this week, turning Witkoff and Kushner’s efforts into a collective push to create an overall plan to stop the fighting, bring home the hostages and work on day-after plans.
“The Doha strike brought them together, with all of the American players saying it is time to end this, so let’s do everything at once. It catalyzed everyone,” a source familiar with the discussions said at the time.
As the new Trump-led framework gained traction, Kushner moved from the background of the discussions to the forefront. He was in the Oval Office in late September when Trump met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, standing behind top Trump administration officials a sofa as the Israeli leader placed an apology call to Qatar’s prime minister.
Later, he huddled with Netanyahu and his delegation to go over the framework point-by-point in the Cabinet Room. And after Netanyahu publicly agreed to the deal during a press conference, he walked alongside the prime minister and Trump down the West Wing Colonnade as they absorbed the moment.
“Jared is a trusted voice on Middle East, as someone who played a major role in the Abraham Accords and he still has great relationships in the region,” an official said, describing Kushner’s value to the mission and his regular communication with Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on relations in the region, with both men valuing his input.
Influential players in the region have also privately welcomed Kushner’s return to the diplomatic scene in an active way, multiple sources said. While officials in the Middle East predicted he would always be involved behind the scenes, many feel his involvement at the table now could drive real results.
“It’s extremely needed to have him in meetings because they listen to him, the Israelis. It’s super needed, otherwise nothing will be done,” said one regional diplomat, adding that Kushner also has personal relationships with the Arab leaders, which could result in effective pressure also being applied to Hamas.
During Trump’s first term, Kushner became close enough with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that the men communicated over text — to the occasional frustration of career national security officials, who were kept in the dark about the substance of the conversations.
On Trump’s first trip abroad to Saudi Arabia in 2017, Kushner and Ivanka Trump were feted alongside the president at a series of ceremonies and events. Later, Kushner would travel on separate visits to the kingdom for discussions with the crown prince that stretched late into the night.
Kushner is also close to Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, who he has known since he was young. An anecdote emerged during Trump’s first presidency that when he was a teenager, Kushner gave up his bedroom for a night so Netanyahu would have a place to sleep while visiting the Kushners’ home in New Jersey.
Kushner himself has not spoken extensively in public on the situation in Gaza, though comments he made during an interview at Harvard University in 2024 caused controversy when he cited the potential real estate value of the besieged Palestinian enclave.
“Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable … if people would focus on building up livelihoods,” Kushner said at the time.
Ultimately, it was a sentiment his father-in-law would come to echo during his first days in office this year, when he proposed seizing Gaza, razing the rubble left from the war and redeveloping the land into a glass-fronted “ Middle Eastern Riviera .”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/americas/peru-president-dina-boluarte-removed-intl-hnk,Dina Boluarte: Peru’s president is removed from office after string of scandals,,,,CNN,"Dina Boluarte, the president of Peru, was removed from office on Thursday after a late-night congressional vote in which parties across the political spectrum called for her ouster.
Boluarte has been under investigation for months over various allegations including bribery and involvement in a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2022.
She has denied all allegations and refused to attend the vote on Thursday, where Congress approved her removal, citing “permanent moral incapacity” to face the onslaught of organized crime in the country.
The president of Congress, 38-year-old José Jerí Oré, will act as interim president and must now call elections, under the constitution.
Boluarte becomes the latest in a long line of disgraced Peruvian leaders. Since the turn of the millennium, no fewer than seven presidents have been brought to trial or faced legal challenges relating to allegations of corruption or human rights abuses. An eighth shot himself dead when police were closing in.
Secret nose job allegations, ‘Rolexgate,’ and the curse of the Peruvian presidency
In 2022, Boluarte became Peru’s first female president after her predecessor Pedro Castillo was arrested and impeached by lawmakers for attempting to dissolve the legislative body and install an emergency government.
But since then, she has been plagued by scandal. The most serious accusations concern the deaths of more than 60 people during a crackdown by government security forces on the protests that followed Castillo’s ouster.
She’s also accused of accepting Rolex watches and other jewelry as bribes, and transporting a fugitive politician in a presidential vehicle.
But the most lurid accusation is that she abandoned her post to get plastic surgery on her nose in 2023 – neglecting to inform Congress or delegate her powers during her nearly two-week absence, as she was constitutionally required to do. She insisted the surgery was “ essential ” for her health. The surgeon who did the operation denied that, saying they were all cosmetic procedures.
Even conservative parties that have historically supported Boluarte turned against her recently, joining the push to remove her from office, Reuters reported – including Rafael Lopez’s Popular Renewal and Keiko Fujimori’s Popular Force, both political heavyweights.
Besides the various political crises, Peru has also faced a security crisis that earlier this year resulted in a state of emergency in the national capital and the province of Callao, with crime surging after the killing of a popular musician.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/asia/north-korea-80-anniversary-parade-intl-hnk,North Korea’s ruling party turns 80 and Kim Jong Un is rolling out the red carpet for a major celebration,,,,CNN,"North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un has rolled out the red carpet for a host of foreign dignitaries, treating them to a spectacle of color and dancing, and all signs suggest he’ll also be showing off his country’s latest military hardware in a pomp-filled parade.
North Korea has kept celebratory plans for the 80th anniversary of the Workers’ Party of Korea tightly under wraps – much like the secretive and isolated state has done in the past with significant dates.
Images released by North Korean state media showed a huge celebration at Pyongyang’s massive May Stadium on Thursday, but the main event could be a parade in the capital Pyongyang, potentially on Friday night, involving tens of thousands of people, according to predictions from the South Korean military.
The anniversary celebration comes a month after the heavily sanctioned Kim scored a major diplomatic victory by traveling to Beijing for China’s massive military parade , where he had the rare chance to stand alongside political heavyweights Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the global stage.
Kim emerged from the visit with deeper strategic ties and a renewed friendship with China, North Korea’s longtime political and economic patron, as well as an increased vigor to pursue his missile and nuclear weapons program.
North Korea and its new military ally Russia have repeatedly affirmed their closer relationship since signing a mutual defense pact last year, and Kim has sent thousands of troops, missiles and munitions to assist Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
In a show of those continued good ties, China and Russia sent delegations led notably by their number 2s to the celebrations in Pyongyang.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief To Lam had front row seats as Kim kicked off celebrations Thursday with mass games and artistic performances.
To much enthusiastic flag-waving, North Korea showcased a medley of traditional and patriotic songs and coordinated dances involving thousands of people, including neatly-dressed children. Impressive displays of martial arts featuring soldiers smashing cinder blocks over their bare stomachs culminated in a huge fireworks and pyrotechnics display.
“Today our people are standing in front of the world as powerful beings who know no insurmountable difficulties and no unachievable cause,” Kim said in a speech, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported.
Speaking to tens of thousands of spectators, Kim said that North Korea had coped with “growing nuclear war threats by the US imperialists” by simultaneously developing its “nuclear forces” and “economic construction.”
“Our Party and government are still coping with our adversaries’ ferocious political and military moves of pressure by pursuing harder-line policies, holding fast to firm principles and employing brave, unflinching countermeasures,” Kim said, according to KCNA.
Huge displays of carefully choreographed propaganda involving massive crowds and meticulously rehearsed performances have long been a hallmark of the North Korean regime, particularly around key anniversaries.
The Workers’ Party of Korea is the sole ruling party of North Korea, blending communism with the words, sayings and ideals of the Kim dynasty, who have imposed their authoritarian rule on the country for three generations.
North Korean military parades have previously been used to showcase the country’s latest developments in advanced weaponry and missiles that, in theory, could threaten the United States. Military watchers play close attention to what Pyongyang chooses to show off at such events.
Analysts have raised the possibility that North Korea’s next-generation Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its new Hwasong-11 Ma hypersonic glide vehicle, and other advanced weapons systems may be on display.
Col. Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), said last week that the military detected movements of vehicles and military equipment ahead of an expected parade.
Last month, Kim observed a test of a new high-thrust solid-fueled rocket engine for its newest ICBM, the Hwasong-20.
Compared with liquid-fueled missiles, solid-fueled rockets are more stable, and can be moved more easily to avoid detection before their launch, which can be initiated within minutes, experts say.

Over the weekend, Kim attended an exhibition featuring some of the country’s latest weapons, including a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) equipped with a hypersonic warhead feature, labeled “Hwasong-11Ma,” according to photos released by KCNA.
The Hwasong-11 series, North Korea’s variant of Russia’s Iskander missile, has an estimated maximum range of approximately 800 kilometers (497 miles).
Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said North Korea could also unveil advanced arms including AI-powered systems or various unmanned vehicles, during the parade.
“The weapons shown in the parade will likely be on an unprecedented scale,” Hong said. “Rather than focusing simply on large numbers, North Korea seem to be set to prioritize revealing systems that are impactful in capability.”
However, it is uncertain whether the highly anticipated Hwasong-20 will be shown, Hong added, as it hasn’t had a full launch test.
Observers are watching for possible test-launches of new, next-generation weapons around the October celebrations, Hong added.
Kim’s illegal nuclear weapons program has transformed North Korea into the most heavily sanctioned state in the world.
In the past few years, the country has ramped up its weapons program and made efforts to bolster its nuclear capability — including a secret missile base near its northern border with China, which could pose a “potential nuclear threat” to much of East Asia and the US.
Secrecy is part and parcel of North Korean parades, especially when Kim is in attendance.
CNN correspondent Will Ripley attended the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party exactly 10 years ago.
“No one seemed to know when it would actually begin — not even our government minders. That’s how things work in North Korea: you wait for hours until someone finally tells you to move,” he said.
Foreigners were sequestered to the Yanggakdo Hotel, which sits on its own island in the middle of the Taedong River in Pyongyang.

“The location isn’t an accident. The island makes it easier for the authorities to control movement in and out, so guests like us can’t wander the city alone. You can look out the windows and see Pyongyang on all sides, but it might as well be another world,” Ripley said.
When journalists were finally herded to the parade grounds, they went through layers of security checks. Phone and laptops had to be left behind.
“When the parade began, the vast square filled with tens of thousands of people. Columns of soldiers marched in perfect step, their boots hitting the pavement with a sharp, rhythmic snap — the famous goose step,” Ripley said.
North Korea has a long history of fraught relations with the United States and South Korea, but now they’re particularly icy, with Kim frequently railing against both countries.
The North Korean leader last weekend said he had assigned “special assets to the major targets of our concern” and pledged to adopt additional military measures to respond to the US’s expanded military assets in South Korea.
“In direct proportion to the US military’s arms buildup in… (South Korea), our strategic concern about this region has also grown,” Kim said. “The enemy, I think, will have to worry about which direction their security environment is moving in.”
Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea’s Kyungnam University, said the “special assets” likely refer to “advanced strategic weapon systems encompassing tactical nuclear weapons and their delivery platforms, hypersonic missiles, and potentially AI-based drones and cyber capabilities.”
Kim Jong Un says he has ‘fond memories’ of Trump, open to talks if US drops denuclearization demand
Kim’s speech, which referenced South Korean security and criticized US military “buildup,” suggested “that these weapons are intended to directly threaten South Korea and US assets in the region,” Lim said.
He viewed Kim’s comments as “an explicit warning that US bases and key facilities in South Korea could become potential targets of North Korean strikes.”
But in contrast to his usual anti-US rhetoric, Kim recently said that he had “fond memories” of President Donald Trump and that there is no reason to avoid dialogue with Washington — if it stops insisting his country give up its nuclear weapons.
South Korea will host a major summit of regional leaders later this month and Trump is expected to attend.
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is viewed as a key opportunity for Trump to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi.
But his presence in the region could also put him in close proximity once again with Kim — six years after talks with Pyongyang during Trump’s last administration collapsed.
Trump signaled last month that he would be keen to sit down with Kim, though some say a meeting is unlikely.
“I will do that, and we’ll have talks. He’d like to meet with me,” Trump claimed. “We look forward to meeting with him, and we’ll make relations better.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/kamala-harris-book-tour-event-letitia-james-indictment,Kamala Harris slams indictment of Letitia James during book tour event in DC,,,,CNN,"Former Vice President Kamala Harris criticized the indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James during an event Thursday in Washington, DC, that was repeatedly disrupted by demonstrators protesting Israel’s war in Gaza.
“Today, I learned that the attorney general in New York just got indicted,” Harris said during the second of two events in DC to promote her book about the 2024 presidential campaign. “Even though the prosecutor who first looked at the case, who I’m told is a very conservative Republican, said there was not enough evidence.”
Harris, who served as district attorney in San Francisco and attorney general of California, slammed the Trump administration’s handling of the Justice Department, calling out US Attorney Lindsey Halligan , Trump’s former personal attorney who has brought charges against the New York attorney general and former FBI Director James Comey since being installed.
“Trump puts in place an incompetent person to make the decision to implement his vengeance agenda,” Harris said. “Think about it, the attorney general of the state of New York has been indicted when a previous prosecutor, who probably did not vote for her or me, said there was not enough evidence.”
James was indicted earlier Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, as Trump’s Justice Department continues to pursue charges against his political opponents. James – who won a civil fraud case against Trump in 2022 – has been under investigation since May for alleged mortgage fraud.
Harris’ remarks in DC on Thursday were interrupted five times by demonstrators who rose from the crowd to protest Israel’s military campaign in Gaza – one shouting, “Your legacy is genocide.”
At the third interruption, the former vice president grew visibly frustrated, telling a protester, “You know what, I am not president of the United States,” and later remarking, “Why don’t you go to the White House and talk to him,” referring to President Donald Trump.
Harris also spoke out against the administration’s nationwide crackdown on immigration enforcement and the move to deploy the National Guard to major cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles.
“I leave and go to Chicago tomorrow, where there are Black Hawks – which are vehicles for war against enemies – and they are dropping Black Hawks in an American city,” Harris said, arguing that “putting America’s military on the streets” is “about striking fear.”
Meanwhile, amid an ongoing government shutdown and federal workers bracing for another round of steep layoffs, Harris encouraged those in civil service to stay in their roles: “I ask you to stay there, because when this is over, there’s gonna be a whole lot of debris and broken stuff.”
“I would encourage you to really stick with it, and know that you are doing noble work that we care about, unlike what this person is trying to suggest about who you and your colleagues are, we need you there,” Harris said, referring to Trump’s repeated criticism of federal employees."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/entertainment/drake-lawsuit-kendrick-lamar-tossed,Judge dismisses Drake’s lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ diss track,,,,CNN,"A federal judge on Thursday dismissed the defamation lawsuit Drake brought against his own record label, Universal Music Group, for publishing and promoting Kendrick Lamar’s diss track “ Not Like Us .”
District Judge Jeannette Vargas concluded that the Grammy-winning song – where Lamar infamously claimed Drake was a “certified pedophile” – was an expression of pure opinion and not an assertion of facts. Therefore, Drake, who denied the allegation, couldn’t sue for defamation.
Drake did not sue Lamar, who was not accused of wrongdoing.
The ruling means Drake’s case against UMG is now over, though he can appeal the decision.
“We intend to appeal today’s ruling, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it,” a spokesperson for Drake told CNN on Thursday night.
The ruling is a major victory for UMG, which has insisted from the beginning that the case was “frivolous” and “illogical.” (Drake sued UMG because Lamar is an Interscope Records artist, which is a division of UMG. Drake’s current label is Republic Records, which is also part of UMG.)
“From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day,” a UMG spokesperson said on Thursday. “We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.”
The judge determined that Lamar’s “offensive” accusations against Drake were protected expression of opinion. Her 38-page ruling included a line-by-line breakdown of lyrics from the songs Drake and Lamar released last year at the height of their feud, where Drake and Lamar traded increasingly personal and unverified insults in a series of songs .
“The average listener is not under the impression that a diss track is the product of a thoughtful or disinterested investigation, conveying to the public fact-checked verifiable content,” Vargas wrote.
The judge also said, “the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us’ imparts verifiable facts” about Drake.
Drake filed the lawsuit in January, and the case was in the evidence-gathering stage known as discovery before the judge threw out the lawsuit Thursday.
“Not Like Us” went on to win multiple Grammys earlier this year and was also featured as part of Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show performance in February."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-trump-indicted-comey-justice-department-analysis,Trump never forgets: Bombshell indictments open a new phase in a retribution presidency,,,,CNN,"Revenge is a dish best served as cold as the Iowa day in January 2024 when Donald Trump set a course that ended with the indictment Thursday of another of his perceived political enemies.
Trump fulminated at a rally in Sioux Center about the multimillion-dollar civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against him, his adult sons and the Trump Organization.
“How would you like to be me? Do you think my life is any fun?” Trump moaned to his crowd, before declaring James should be “arrested and punished accordingly.”
Twenty-one months on, Trump’s handpicked prosecutor secured an indictment against James — weeks after the president listed the New York AG in an angry social media post to Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding charges.
The new bombshell came only a day after former FBI chief James Comey appeared in court to be arraigned — another case against a Trump foe. Comey has pleaded not guilty to the two charges: providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding
It requires a staggering suspension of disbelief not to see the brace of indictments as the latest step in Trump’s retribution tour. The Justice Department, which the president long complained was weaponized against him, is now openly a tool in his bid for political vengeance . Sometimes it’s hard to fathom that this is taking place in the United States, once the global standard for justice and democracy.
Trump isn’t even hiding what he’s doing — the evidence is in the Truth Social post of September 20 , addressed to Bondi, which mentions Comey, James and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” Trump wrote.
Like any other citizen, James will have the chance to answer the allegations in court, and before a jury if the case goes to trial. She is accused of two felony charges: bank fraud and making false statements to an institution in paperwork related to a mortgage for a home she purchased in Virginia. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system,” James said in a statement in which she blasted the charges as “baseless” and political retribution.
The bar for prosecutors to secure a grand jury indictment is far lower than the standard required to convict in a jury trial. But Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor, said on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” that the indictment looked questionable, saying, “It’s deeply suspect that it is a real case.”
Like the Comey indictment, the one against James was brought by Trump’s former personal attorney Lindsey Halligan, who was recently installed as US attorney of the Eastern District of Virginia. CNN reported last month that DOJ prosecutors in Virginia, led at the time by Erik Siebert, interviewed dozens of witnesses and did not believe had they gathered enough evidence to support criminal charges against James. Under pressure by Trump to bring charges against Comey and James, Siebert resigned and was replaced by Halligan .
It’s no surprise that Trump, whose life creed requires that no slight goes unanswered, went after James.
James brought a successful civil prosecution against Trump in New York in which a judge found Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization liable for inflating the value of their properties and ordered them to pay $355 million. An appeals court has since thrown out the penalties and Trump is appealing the verdict.
It might be possible at a pinch to believe that James is just another would-be defendant who is being investigated by the authorities. But in the real world, following the Comey indictment and Trump’s perpetual threats to use his power to pursue retribution against those he regards as political enemies, his conduct adds up to a chilling trend of assaults against the rule of law.
This week alone, he transported National Guard troops from a Republican-run state, Texas, to enforce his mass deportation campaign in a Democratic one, Illinois — against the wishes of the state and local authorities. He tried to pull reservists from California to deploy in Portland, Oregon. Both deployments have been temporarily blocked by judges .
On Wednesday, in another example of his use of vast presidential power to intimidate, Trump called for the jailing of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.
The apparent new American reality that a president can simply order up indictments against political opponents represents a grave threat to the democratic political system.
“It’s just a broken way to do politics, it is corrupt, and I think that anyone who cares about the Constitution and cares about our institutions surviving should care that the president of the United States is using Pam Bondi to do his bidding against adversaries,” Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Thursday.
The president and his supporters have long argued that the Biden administration weaponized the Justice Department against him to thwart his return to the White House.
New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, a possible Republican gubernatorial candidate, said action against James was overdue and welcomed her indictment. “For years, Letitia James has illegally weaponized her office to conduct a political witch hunt against Democrats’ political opponents most notably President Donald J. Trump,” Stefanik said in a statement posted on X.
Trump’s fury is proof that the flurry of indictments against Trump after he left office in 2020 ended up being politically counterproductive, even if they were legally sound. And while there is no evidence that former President Joe Biden participated in the kind of indictment shopping that Trump enjoys, it’s a fair question whether the current president was a victim of overzealous prosecutors in some of the cases against him.
When she ran for office as a Democrat, James pledged to take on Trump. In the civil fraud case, his lawyers accused her of building her political career on persecuting him. While Trump was found liable for fraud, some experts did question whether he was singled out because of who he was, and whether, had he been a New York businessman not involved in politics, things might have been different. Some legal scholars also raised questions about the rationale for a separate criminal hush money case against Trump, also in New York, in which he was found guilty.
But the federal crimes with which Trump was charged by the Justice Department related to his attempt to steal the 2020 election in an unprecedented assault on American democracy and over his alleged hoarding of classified information. Those cases, which went away when he became president again, were based on a solid evidential record. Trump denied wrongdoing to all charges in all cases .
The idea that Trump was being prosecuted for political reasons became the driving force of his 2024 campaign, and was skillfully wielded by the president to bind his voters into his persecution cult. The strategy was epitomized by a mug shot of Trump taken in an Atlanta jail where he was booked in another case, that one to do with alleged election meddling in Georgia.
The feud one with James is one of Trump’s most vituperative.
In breaks in the New York fraud trial, the former and future president would rail against her, claiming she was a “racist” and a “fascist.”
The disdain was mutual. James riffed on Trump’s famed catchphrase when she accused him of being a master of the “Art of the Steal.” She seemed to have perfected the art of getting under his skin. “No matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law,” James said before court one morning.
Most days, James would sit in court a few rows behind Trump, who was at a table with his lawyers — literally and figuratively looking over his shoulder. During the long days of the trial — at least, when he wasn’t acting up and angering the judge — Trump looked deflated and almost humiliated.
This miserable experience, hinted at in his social media order to Bondi, is a clue to his motivation now. While it will be months before the cases against James and Comey come to trial, if they ever do, each now faces the stigma of being a criminal defendant after years on the other side of the courtroom.
So even if Trump doesn’t get the satisfaction of seeing his foes convicted, they may at least suffer some of the pain — personal, reputational, and financial — that he believes was inflicted on him. That’s not to say his conduct is understandable or rational. For one thing, it sets a terrible precedent and raises the possibility that future presidents might follow suit in a never-ending cycle of judicial and political retribution.
“You know, whatever threshold gets set here is the new floor for future prosecutions when roles are reversed. That’s just the way this town works,” Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN’s Manu Raju on Thursday.
But Trump is not looking that far ahead. His strategy now can best be summed up by comments he made in an interview on Sirius XM radio after hearing in 2023 that Republicans had opened an impeachment investigation against Biden (which ended up going nowhere).
“They did it to me,” Trump told Megyn Kelly. “I think had they not done it to me … perhaps you wouldn’t have it being done to them. This is going to happen with indictments too,” he said.
Asked whether he’d turn indictments against Democrats if he won a second term, Trump replied, “I would never have even thought about doing it, but now you certainly have to think about it differently. It doesn’t mean I’d do it, because I think it is so bad for the country.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/letitia-james-grand-jury-trump-indictment,"Letitia James, the New York attorney general who defeated Trump in court, indicted by Justice Department",,,,CNN,"New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, as President Donald Trump’s Justice Department continues to pursue charges against his political opponents.
James has been under investigation since May over a 2023 mortgage she took out to buy a home in Norfolk, Virginia. Thursday’s indictment focused on a 2020 mortgage for a different property in Norfolk.
The grand jury returned two felony charges: bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James’ first court appearance is scheduled for October 24 in Norfolk.
According to the indictment, James claimed on mortgage paperwork that a home she purchased in Norfolk would be her second residence. That claim allowed her to get favorable loan terms not available for investment properties, prosecutors say.
But, prosecutors allege, James did not use the house and instead rented the property to a family of three. They allege she falsely stated in loan applications that the residence would be a secondary home when they allege James knew she would use it as an investment property.
According to the indictment, James received a lower mortgage rate on the property as a secondary mortgage than she would have had it been treated as an investment property. Prosecutors allege James received improper gains of $18,933 over the life of the loan.
The charges come as Trump continues to call for his enemies to be prosecuted in court. Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty Wednesday to allegedly making a false statement in a congressional proceeding. The Justice Department has also opened investigation into former Trump national security adviser John Bolton , California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff , and others.
“This is nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system,” James said in a statement.
“These charges are baseless, and the president’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost,” she added. “The president’s actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.”
Tracking Trump’s retaliation
James’ relationship with Trump has been adversarial for years as James campaigned on promises to investigate Trump and ultimately won a civil fraud case against Trump, his adult sons and his real estate business. A judge found them liable for fraud for inflating the value of their properties, and ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties.
A New York appeals court tossed the penalties and Trump has appealed the verdict.
During the 11-week trial, Trump’s anger toward James was palpable. He railed against her in the courthouse hallways and from the witness stand. Trump testified as James sat across from him in the courtroom galley.
“This is a political witch hunt and I think she should be ashamed of herself,” Trump testified. “You believe this political hack back there and that’s unfortunate.”
James often punched back outside of the courtroom, on social media or in video statements.
Last month CNN reported that Justice Department prosecutors in Virginia, led at the time by Erik Siebert, interviewed dozens of witnesses and did not believe they gathered enough evidence to support criminal charges against James.
Under pressure by Trump to bring charges against Comey and James, Siebert resigned and was replaced as US attorney by Trump’s former personal attorney Lindsey Halligan .
“No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public’s trust,” Halligan said in a statement. “The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.”
Ed Martin, Trump’s Justice Department weaponization chief, posted on social media after the charges were announced: “Promises made, Promises kept.”
Martin previously posed for photos outside of James’ Brooklyn home in August and called on her to resign in a letter to her attorney.
The investigation had focused on a mortgage obtained in 2023 for a property in Norfolk.
Her attorneys provided a document to the Justice Department in April to push back on what they called “threadbare” allegations.
They said that one document in the mortgage application “mistakenly” said the property would be James’ primary residence. But they submitted other documents to argue there was no fraud.
In one document, James writes in an email to her loan originator, “this property WILL NOT be my primary residence.”
That property in question, however, was unrelated to the underlying charges in the indictment, according to a source familiar.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/court-national-guard-chicago-portland,Court battles over National Guard troops deliver win to Chicago while Portland awaits a decision. Get the key takeaways,,,,CNN,"Federal courtrooms on opposite sides of the country on Thursday served as stages for the ongoing showdown between Democratic-led cities and the Trump administration, as judges weighed whether the president is exceeding his authority by deploying National Guard troops to quell demonstrations outside ICE facilities near Chicago and Portland.
In a scathing oral ruling from Chicago, US District Court Judge April Perry granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in the state of Illinois for two weeks.
“I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”
Sending in troops would “only add fuel to the fire,” Perry added. It’s unclear what the next steps will be for guardsmen already on the ground in the Chicago area. The Department of Defense told CNN troops “will remain in a federalized status” while the order is in force.
Meanwhile on the West Coast, a three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered whether the Trump administration should be blocked from federalizing the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision, though state Attorney General Dan Rayfield said he expects a ruling “in the coming days.”
Though the hearings occurred thousands of miles apart, the arguments were eerily similar, pitching both sides against each other as they painted starkly different pictures of the reality on the ground  – and fundamentally disagreed over whether it rises to the severity of federal intervention.
The outcome of the twin hearings could set a precedent for future federal intervention in local law enforcement, though Trump has suggested he would look for a way to circumvent the courts if they do not rule in his favor.
Here are the key takeaways from today’s proceedings.
Leaders in Oregon and Illinois have emphatically disputed the Trump administration’s characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground is not as extreme as federal officials are portraying it to be.
In her ruling, Judge Perry noted the largest protests at the ICE facility in the suburb of Broadview, Illinois, did not exceed about 200 attendees. In that instance, she said, about 100 state and local law enforcement officers were present and capable of handling the crowd.
Intervention from federal officials has not seemed necessary, and the deployment of troops into Chicago’s suburb could fuel “civil unrest,” Perry said.
When federal officers have become involved, their use of chemical agents has “been arbitrary and indiscriminate,” she added, citing Broadview police.  Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson has previously accused federal agents of creating “chaos” by “needlessly deploying tear gas, pepper spray, mace and rubber bullets at individuals and reporters.”
The Trump administration has accused protesters in Broadview of fostering “ongoing and sustained violence” against ICE personnel and federal property.
In the administration’s filings in Chicago, attorneys claim they have documented injuries including a torn ACL, a hyper-extended knee, multiple lacerations, and a beard ripped from an officer’s face. Some officers have also been hospitalized after being physically tackled by rioters, the filing alleges.
An Illinois attorney said some of the conduct by protesters against officials is “of course deplorable,” but local law enforcement should be given deference to handle the situation.
The three-judge appeals court panel – which included two Trump appointees – challenged the Oregon attorney on several occasions during the hearing, appearing skeptical of their claims about the severity of the protests.
During arguments, state Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin pointed out that a lower court found “that the Portland ICE facility protests were small, less than 30 people, largely sedate and generally peaceful.”
Judge Ryan D. Nelson – a Trump appointee – shot back, saying the claim was “clearly erroneous.”
“There’s clearly been protests that were above 30 (people),” Nelson said. “Unless you’re trying to limit it to certain time periods, we have evidence in the record that there were protests as much as 200.”
“It was generally small,” Chaffin said.
Department of Justice attorneys told the judges protests at the facility have “significantly impeded” federal agents. DOJ attorney Eric McArthur argued the demonstrators are “hardly the peaceful and sedate crowd” that the State of Oregon “tried to make it out to be.”
The judges’ questions indicated their ruling may consider protests that took place in months past, not the current situation on the ground.
Judge Bridget Bade, the other Trump appointee, noted the ICE facility was closed for more than three weeks starting in mid-June at the height of the protest violence.
“Are those facts that are not relevant for the president to determine the threat and whether there’s a threat to DHS being able to enforce the 400 laws it’s tasked with enforcing?” asked Bade.
Chaffin argued the court should not judge the need for military action in Portland now based on events from months ago. Oregon attorneys argued that Trump acted retroactively when he cited past clashes as justification for sending in the Guard.
Nelson again challenged the state.
“You’re saying, well, if you don’t hit it within a narrow window, you lose your right (to enact the military),” Nelson said. “That just seems unnaturally constrained.”
Even if the court sides with the Trump administration and allows federalization of the Oregon National Guard, troops still cannot be deployed to Portland under a separate court order in effect until at least October 19.
“Rebellion, Insurrection. War. These are heavy words,” an Illinois attorney said at the top of the Chicago hearing.
Attorneys in both cases seemed to agree that the existential threat of a rebellion against the US government – one of the few circumstances in which the president has the legal authority to federalize the National Guard –  is a serious matter.
But what constitutes a rebellion and how it is defined in the eyes of the law was the key point of disagreement between the states and the Trump administration in both hearings.
“There is no rebellion in Illinois,” an attorney for the state said, calling the claim of a threat of rebellion “audacious.”
In her ruling, Perry said she saw no evidence of rebellion, which she defined as “deliberate, organized resistance openly opposing the government as a whole.”
Earlier, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton argued there did not need to be a real act of rebellion, only the threat of one.
He also said the court doesn’t need to decide what a rebellion is.
“I think I do,” Perry replied.
Meanwhile in Portland,  Judge Susan P. Graber asked the DOJ attorneys at the top of the hearing whether the demonstrations in Portland met the legal standard of a “rebellion.”
McArthur, the DOJ attorney, said rebellion is “a deliberate, organized resistance by force and arms to the laws and operations of the government.”
The state argued for a stricter legal definition. Chaffin said rebellions “are unusual and extreme emergencies,” pointing out that the other circumstances in which presidents have the power to federalize guardsmen involve invasion from foreign powers. She argued the situation should be considered a rebellion when circumstances arise, “which may be vital to the existence of the Union.”
Pressed by Judge Perry about whether the National Guard presence in Illinois would be limited to certain locations, the Justice Department suggested they could be deployed beyond the area around the Broadview ICE facility.
Perry asked whether soldiers may also be present in neighborhoods, including near schools. Hamilton said that it could be possible when protecting federal agents or property.
“Will they be solving crime in Chicago?” Perry asked Hamilton.
“Certainly, to an extent,” Hamilton responded. He added: “The mission, again, is a federal protective one.”
As the Chicago hearing came to a close, the judge heard a final plea from the state, urging her to recognize what it sees as an existential threat to constitutionally protected states’ rights.
Christopher Wells, an attorney from the Illinois Attorney General’s Office, asserted the day’s arguments represented one thing. “That fight is the Tenth Amendment. Full stop,” he said, referring to the amendment that reserves power for the states.
Wells described Trump’s attempt to circumvent the state’s will as shocking and “authoritarian.” He warned the moment represented a “grave risk of wanton tyranny.”
The Justice Department followed with closing statements, and Hamilton argued Trump’s judgment is “unreviewable.”
One of the judges reviewing the Portland case acknowledged concerns about the potential for setting a dangerous precedent.
Judge Nelson told the court he was not “trying to diminish” concerns that the National Guard’s deployment is a “slippery slope” and did not rule out the possibility that troops may be used unlawfully in the future.
“I’m not trying to diminish that,” Nelson said of the concern of unlawful use of troops. “It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don’t have any evidence of that right now.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/army-million-dollar-donation-conference-government-shutdown,US Army accepting roughly $1 million donation to bring senior leaders to DC conference amid government shutdown,,,,CNN,"The US Army is accepting a donation of roughly $1 million for the travel and lodging of senior leaders to a professional development conference in Washington, DC, next week, as active duty forces are bracing for a missed paycheck amid the government shutdown, multiple US officials told CNN.
Many of the Army leaders and their staffs who had already processed paperwork to attend the annual Association of the US Army conference in downtown DC next week will have their travel, hotels and meals covered by funds donated by Association of the United States Army. AUSA is a nonprofit professional development association that serves the Army.
A spokesperson for AUSA, Tom McCuin, declined to comment on the donation amount but said it was “enough to fund what the Army had planned to bring.”
The viability of the conference had been in question after the government shut down, which meant there were no funds to pay for travel or per diems. One of the US officials said it is standard for AUSA to donate money to the Army to bring in leaders for the conference, though they said it appears the recent $1 million donation was in addition to the typical amount due to funding challenges brought by the shutdown. McCuin also said AUSA provides a “proffer” to the Army ever year to cover some attendees, and has since 2013.
“I think the Secretary was keen to make sure that people had the opportunity to attend what is first and foremost a professional development event,” McCuin said. “Because of the shutdown, there’s no money in the budget in the travel, and we were able to help out with that.”
The annual AUSA conference is a sprawling gathering in downtown DC of Army leaders, their staffs, defense industry executives and foreign military representatives. Typically, senior leaders have held media roundtables and press conferences, while military officials have attended speaking engagements, workshops and received updates on the Army’s goals in the upcoming year.
A second US official said the intent for bringing the senior leaders in for the conference was to attend the Leader Solarium event, an invitation-only event for battalion commanders and sergeants major across the Army. The US official described it as a workshop where the invited leaders pitch solutions to a posed problem statement to the Army secretary, chief of staff, and sergeant major of the Army.
“I can’t tell you a single actionable initiative to come out of it,” the second official said. The first US official said who would come was being determined based on things like the presentations they were expected to give or participate in.
The conference comes as National Guard troops deployed in DC and various other cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago, as well as active-duty forces around the globe, are not receiving their next paycheck. CNN reported last week that military families were bracing for a missed paycheck on October 15; some families have preemptively visited their local food pantries to stock up on groceries and supplies in case the shutdown drags on.
The first US official said it was “devastating” that troops were facing financial hardship because of the shutdown — particularly more junior service members who may not have a savings cushion to rely on.
“We need to engage with industry and tell them the things we need and want, and we need to tell the Army story to America and highlight the great things our soldiers are doing … I totally can see that it just doesn’t look great especially when our whole force is about to miss a pay period or two or three, or however long this thing goes,” the official said."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/virginia-governor-debate-takeaways,Takeaways from the only debate in the Virginia governor’s race,,,,CNN,"In the only debate of the Virginia governor’s race, Democrat Abigail Spanberger did not affirm her endorsement of Jay Jones , the party’s nominee for attorney general who said in recently disclosed text messages that a Republican colleague should be shot in the head.
But she also didn’t take back her endorsement either or call for Jones to exit the race, even as her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, repeatedly urged her to do so.
“It’s up to every voter to make their own individual decision,” Spanberger said on Thursday night.
The candidates’ tactics, in their only scheduled meeting before the November 4 election, offered a clear glimpse of where the race stands.
Spanberger, the former congresswoman who is well ahead in the polls, tried to play it safe and ducked questions even after they were repeated. Earle-Sears, seeking to make up ground, interrupted Spanberger during nearly every answer her Democratic rival gave during the hour-long debate, from the first question all the way through Spanberger’s closing statement, drawing frequent admonishments from the moderators.
Virginia and New Jersey are the two states choosing governors this year in races that are traditional barometers of the national political mood one year into a president’s term.
Here are four takeaways from the debate:
Jones’ texts, first published by the National Review and later obtained by CNN, have become the focal point of the governor’s race. The first opportunity Earle-Sears had to speak, she sidestepped a question about eliminating the state’s car tax to put Spanberger on the spot.
“Abigail, when are you going to take Jay Jones and say to him, ‘You must leave the race?’” she said.
Spanberger ignored Earle-Sears then. But moments later, she was asked by moderators whether she will continue to endorse Jones.
“The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent. I denounced them when I learned of them, and I will denounce them every opportunity I get,” she said.
She wouldn’t directly answer whether Jones still has her endorsement, or whether he should drop out, despite several follow-ups from moderators and Earle-Sears.
“I’m saying as of now, it’s up to every voter to make their own individual decision. I am running for governor. I am accountable for the words that I say or the acts that I take, or the policies that I have put out,” she said.
Earle-Sears pounced, saying she wondered “why she won’t say it is not okay and that he must leave the race,” pointing out that Jones’ text messages also included suggesting his Republican colleague’s two young children should die.
“You have little girls. Would it take him pulling the trigger? Is that what would do it, and then you would say he needs to get out of the race?” Earle-Sears said. “Abigail, you have nothing to say?”
Spanberger didn’t respond.
Notably, under Virginia law, there doesn’t appear to be any way for Jones to formally leave the race at this point without Democrats essentially conceding the election.
Early voting is already underway. There’s no deadline under Virginia law for a candidate to withdraw from an election, but it’s too late to remove a name or add a replacement to the physical ballot, Brian Tynes, a spokesman for the state Department of Elections, previously told CNN in an email.
Moderators also put Earle-Sears on the spot about President Donald Trump. The lieutenant governor, who has closely aligned herself with Trump, was asked whether there is a place for rhetoric like what Trump used at conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s funeral, when the president said he doesn’t like his opponents and doesn’t want the best for them.
She said she “wouldn’t say that. I would not speak that way.” But she did not directly condemn Trump’s remarks.
Spanberger shot back: “When violent rhetoric comes from her side of the aisle, she refuses to denounce it.”
“He did not advocate murder,” Earle-Sears said.
The Republican was also asked if she needs the endorsement of Trump to win in November. Trump hasn’t backed Earle-Sears – years after she called on him not to run for president a third time – even as he’s endorsed Republicans for Virginia attorney general and New Jersey governor.
“I will take all endorsements, including the president,” she said.
Trump snubs Virginia’s GOP nominee for governor even as she’s attacked as too ‘MAGA’
Spanberger was asked whether transgender students should be allowed to play sports and use locker rooms corresponding to their gender identity, and whether she would rescind Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s policy requiring boys and girls to use bathrooms aligning to their biological sex.
She didn’t take a position, saying those decisions should be made locally.
“In each local community, decisions should be made between parents and educators and teachers,” she said.
Earle-Sears has centered her campaign on trans issues and repeatedly pressed Spanberger to more directly answer the question.
At one point, Spanberger said, “There should never be naked men in locker rooms,” which partially echoed what Earle-Sears often says on the issue. In a Facebook post last month, Earle-Sears wrote: “Why can’t Abigail say it? Naked men don’t belong in bathrooms and locker rooms with young girls.”
The Democrat also sought to go on offense when she accused Earle-Sears of a history of discrimination, including opposing same-sex marriage, and for saying on a 2004 survey, when she was a congressional candidate, that she opposed workplace protections that include sexual orientation.
“That’s not discrimination,” Earle-Sears responded. “No.”
Her comment was noteworthy in part because the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, John Reid, is the first openly gay man to appear on a Virginia GOP ticket.
Spanberger said she supports codifying Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a federal right to abortion that was overturned in 2022 . The state’s voters could decide in 2026 whether to amend Virginia’s constitution to do just that.
She was asked if she supports any restrictions on abortion rights and said she supports “the current laws within Virginia,” which include requiring parental consent for minors to receive abortions and allowing third-trimester abortions only when the life of the mother is threatened.
“But importantly, my opponent has threatened murder to women who have had abortions,” she said.
Spanberger appeared to be referring to a 2022 comment Earle-Sears made in a radio interview, which the Democrat’s campaign highlighted in an ad released just before the debate began. “Murder is murder, and one day it’s going to be your turn,” Earle-Sears said then.
However, on Thursday night, Earle-Sears didn’t advocate any new abortion restrictions, an indication of how politically problematic the issue has been for swing-state Republicans in recent years.
“It’s not my view. It’s going to be what the majority of Virginians want,” she said. “And by the way, there’s a constitutional amendment, and the voters will make that decision.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/cdc-acip-vaccine-working-group,New group will evaluate childhood vaccines for RFK Jr.’s handpicked CDC advisory panel,,,,CNN,"A new working group of outside advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will convene to assess the safety, effectiveness and timing of the shots children and adolescents get, as well as whether the schedule should be changed, according to a new document posted on the CDC’s website.
This group will be part of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP, a panel of independent experts who regularly meet to assess what vaccines should be given to the public and when. In an unprecedented move , US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members of ACIP in June and replaced them with his own picks, some of whom have made false claims about vaccines.
ACIP regularly uses smaller work groups to prompt discussions on recommendations under consideration by the broader committee. But the new CDC document does not pinpoint any single study showing a problem with the current way kids in the US gets their shots that would prompt the formation of this new group.
CDC advisers vote that patients must consult a health care provider for Covid-19 vaccination, but no prescription required
Many of the vaccines on the current schedule are universally recommended worldwide, the document notes, but different countries have different schedules, and the rationale for this group “includes considerations such as the use of new vaccine technologies and ingredients, and the rise of vaccine hesitancy.”
The ACIP working group will prepare information for the broader committee to make recommendations that consider the timing of the vaccines, when to give vaccines concurrently, the safety of the ingredients in the vaccines, the efficacy and safety of schedules used in other countries, and the financial burden these vaccines place on parents and providers.
The names of the working group members and who will lead it have not been disclosed. The CDC document says the new working group will meet on an as-needed basis, but its meetings and materials won’t be available to the public, unlike ACIP meetings.
One of the group’s focuses will be an examination of substances added to vaccines to increase their efficacy, called adjuvants. The document gives the example of aluminum and whether it raises a child’s risk of asthma. Aluminum salts are used in several childhood vaccines because they allow doctors to give fewer doses of a vaccine, and a smaller amount of the vaccine is needed to protect the child.
A 2023 observational study found a possible association between exposure to aluminum in vaccines and asthma, but the researchers cautioned that the effect size was small and the study had significant limitations. For example, the research couldn’t determine what other factors may lead to a person developing asthma, like genetics or exposure to secondhand smoke.
A more recent study published in July looked at records for more than 1.2 million Danish children and found that cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccination during the first two years of life was not associated with increased rates of any of the 50 disorders assessed, including asthma.
Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, has taken issue with the Danish study and said it should be retracted. He wrote in an editorial that the study’s methodology, analysis and results were flawed, and he claimed that the authors “meticulously designed it not to find harm.” The journal where it was published, Annals of Internal Medicine, said it stood by the study and had no plans to retract it.
RFK Jr.’s HHS re-establishes childhood vaccine safety task force after pressure from his former anti-vaccine advocacy group
Childhood vaccination has become a hot topic within the Trump administration.
In a Cabinet meeting Thursday, President Donald Trump made a number of false claims about vaccines given to children, including that babies get 82 vaccines in a single shot. He also said babies are given vaccine doses the size of two glasses of water, but a standard dose for most vaccines is a small fraction of a teaspoon.
Two weeks ago, in a news conference on autism, the president mentioned that he had “been hearing” that the combination shot used to protect children from measles, mumps and rubella is “bad.” Trump said companies should split up the MMR shot into three. The acting CDC director has also called for vaccine makers to develop separate shots against these conditions, even though the CDC’s website says there is no evidence that there would be any benefit to giving them separately.
Anti-vaccine group that RFK Jr. founded says it’s funding lawsuit against him over vaccine safety task force
Kennedy had promised at his confirmation hearing that he “will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines,” but critics — even some Republicans — have started to express concerns.
At a hearing in September, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he had grown “deeply concerned” over Kennedy’s handling of vaccines. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana accused Kennedy of breaking his promise, saying that Kennedy’s moves mean “effectively, we’re denying people vaccines,” but Kennedy retorted sharply “You’re wrong.”
In May, HHS terminated a $590 million contract with Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine project, and in August, it canceled $500 million in research into mRNA vaccines.
In August, HHS re-established the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines , a panel of US health officials tasked with making recommendations on vaccine development, distribution and monitoring. The move followed a lawsuit filed by attorney Ray Flores , who is the senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine advocacy group formerly led by Kennedy."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/30/politics/retaliation-tracker-trump-vis,Tracking Trump’s retaliation,,,,CNN,"During the last presidential campaign, Donald Trump made clear his motivations in trying to retake the White House.
“In 2016, I declared ‘I am your voice.’ Today I add, I am your warrior, I am your justice and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” Trump said at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference.
More than two years later, Trump has so far used his second term to make good on that promise, enacting what in many cases appears to be payback against a wide swath of critics and perceived political enemies.
Through a mix of presidential powers including executive orders and federal investigations, Trump has sought retribution on a number of fronts, targeting those involved in the multiple legal cases against him, including his indictments for hoarding classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election , as well as the probe into Russia’s election interference in the 2016 election.
In a high-profile case, New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on October 9 on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James led the successful civil fraud lawsuit against Trump, three of his children and a pair of business associates.
A few weeks earlier, former FBI director James Comey was indicted on September 25 on charges of obstruction of a congressional proceeding and giving false statements. He is the first person to face federal charges in one of Trump’s largest grievances: the 2016 investigation into whether his first presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Comey pleaded not guilty to both charges.
Trump told reports following Comey’s indictment that he expects other political opponents to be prosecuted.
“It’s not a list, but I think there will be others,” Trump said.
In another act of retribution, the home of John Bolton — Trump’s former national security adviser who has since become publicly critical of his former boss — was searched by the FBI on August 22, which some saw as an escalation of the president’s retribution agenda. The investigation first began in 2020 and was recently reopened by the Justice Department. Senior Justice Department leaders are advocating for a charge against Bolton, sources tell CNN .
Trump also moved to canceled the Secret Service detail of former Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the 2024 election. The president also previously canceled the security details of Bolton and Gen. Mark Milley , an official from his first term.
Trump has also revoked the security clearances of more than 100 people so far, including high-ranking officials from the Biden administration, and many other long-time government officials. He’s also fired scores of people, and sought to investigate many of his public critics, including former members of his own prior administration.
Several of Trump’s actions have faced legal challenges — with mixed success. Among the people targeted by Trump, several have yet to comment, while others have remained defiant. Some have also slammed his moves as being politically motivated.
In a statement to CNN, the White House said: “Joe Biden weaponized his Administration to target political opponents – most famously, President Trump.”
“President Trump is restoring integrity to our government,” White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said in the statement. “Anyone who engages in criminal activity should be held accountable. No one is above the law. President Trump’s only retribution is success and historic achievements for the American people.”
Here are some of the people Trump and his administration have targeted:
Trump faced four indictments and one conviction during his time out of office, along with a loss in a civil case involving his business. The president has since decried that all the probes were politically motivated weaponization of the Justice Department.
Prior to her October indictment , New York Attorney General Letitia James was under investigation since May over a 2023 mortgage she took out to help her niece buy a home in Norfolk, Virginia. In August, the Justice Department subpoenaed James’ office, seeking information about her investigations into the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, sources told CNN. A grand jury investigation into James is also underway, according to a source familiar, which looks into whether James violated Trump’s constitutional rights.
“Attorney General James is focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers, especially as this Administration weaponizes the federal government against the rule of law and the Constitution,” a spokesperson for James said in a statement to CNN. “She will not be intimidated by bullies – no matter who they are.”
Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led criminal probes into Trump’s handling of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election, is also under investigation. The Office of the Special Counsel — which is distinct from special counsels, like Smith, who are appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations — is probing Smith for allegedly violating the Hatch Act , which limits certain political activities of government workers.
Attorneys for Smith said in a letter obtained by CNN that the investigation is based on “imaginary and unfounded” accusations.
“Mr. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper,” his attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski wrote.
Trump also took aim at the National Archives, a historically non-political agency that became embroiled in Trump’s legal cases after it asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left office in his first term.
Soon after returning to the White House, Trump fired Colleen Shogan , the archivist of the United States, and forced out deputy archivist William Bosanko . A source told CNN that Trump officials made it clear to staff at the National Archives that the White House wanted to remove the leadership team and replace top officials with Trump loyalists.
Shogan said on LinkedIn at the time that she wasn’t given any reason for her firing, adding, “I have zero regrets.”
In August, Brian Driscoll — the former acting FBI director before Trump’s nominee Kash Patel was confirmed — was also fired. Driscoll said in a letter to his colleagues that he was not given a reason for his firing either, adding, “Our collective sacrifices for those we serve is, and will always be, worth it. I regret nothing,”
A source told CNN that among the issues that caused discord with top officials in the FBI was Driscoll not disciplining an FBI pilot for Patel after it was discovered he was involved in issuing a subpoena in the Mar-a-Lago investigation into Trump and associates.
In his effort to shrink and overhaul the federal workforce, Trump directed agencies to fire employees en masse. Then, the president fired two officials who were tasked with protecting federal employees.
In February, Hampton Dellinger — the former head of the Office of Special Counsel who protected whistleblowers from retaliation — and Cathy Harris — former chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal employee firings — were removed from their jobs.
Dellinger sued the Trump administration but after some legal back and forth, he ultimately dropped his case , citing long odds of winning at the Supreme Court after the federal Circuit Court in Washington, DC sided with Trump’s Justice Department to keep him out of the special counsel role.
Dellinger said in a statement at the time, “The harm to the agency and those who rely on it caused by a Special Counsel who is not independent could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.”
A federal judge in March ruled that Harris can keep her job , finding that Trump unlawfully fired her. Harris celebrated the ruling at the time, saying “I’m glad the Court has ruled on just how illegal Donald Trump’s action here has been.”
Trump also fired a high-ranking official critical of his efforts to reshape the federal government.
Cameron Hamilton, acting director of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was removed from his job in May — a day after he broke with the administration and told lawmakers that he does not support dismantling the agency.
And in August, FEMA placed several employees on administrative leave effective immediately, just one day after they signed an open letter warning Congress that the Trump administration’s sweeping ﻿overhaul of the agency could lead to catastrophic failures in disaster response.
In the letter, more than 180 current and former FEMA employees — most signing anonymously — asked Congress to make FEMA a Cabinet-level, independent agency – insulated from political meddling and empowered to respond swiftly when disaster strikes.
The authors warned in the letter: “we hope (these changes) come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people.”
Trump has defended rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, since the end of his first term. Once he returned to office, he gave broad clemency to the rioters and targeted those who investigated and brought charges against them.
Michael Gordon, the former assistant US Attorney in the US Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida, was fired in June. In a lawsuit with two other former Justice Department officials, Gordon claims that his dismissal was a “ retaliation ” because he prosecuted high-profile January 6 cases.
Similarly, Steve Jensen — the former acting director of the Washington Field Office for the FBI, who played a role in the investigation of January 6 rioters — was also dismissed from his role in August.
Trump has also gone after James Dennehy, the head of the FBI’s New York division, who vowed to support FBI employees who were asked to explain their involvement in the agency’s investigation of January 6. After saying that he’s preparing to “dig in” to defend those FBI employees, Dennehy wrote in an email to colleagues in March that he was told he “needed” to retire.
Four officials from Trump’s first term are currently under investigation after speaking out against the president.
The FBI’s search of Bolton’s home was part of a renewed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump had previously threatened to jail Bolton over the 2020 book, which was critical of Trump’s foreign policy knowledge, and the Justice Department investigated him during Trump’s first term.
Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has also been a critic of his former boss and even called him a fascist. Just days into Trump’s second term, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered an investigation into Milley to determine whether a review of his rank is necessary.
Meanwhile, via executive orders , Trump called for an investigation into former Department of Homeland Security official Miles Taylor and former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs.
Taylor anonymously wrote a 2018 New York Times op-ed claiming he was part of the “resistance” to Trump’s presidency. In the op-ed, Taylor said “many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” Taylor, who subsequently went public as the author of the op-ed in October 2020, went on to write a book, “Anonymous,” that was critical of Trump.
Speaking at the White House after the executive order, Trump claimed that Taylor was “guilty of treason.”
Taylor responded to the executive order in a post on X , saying, “I said this would happen. Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path. Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.”
Krebs was fired during Trump’s first term after he rejected the president’s claims of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election.
“He’s the fraud. He’s a disgrace,” Trump said of Krebs in April.
Following the executive order, Krebs resigned as the chief intelligence and public policy officer at SentinelOne, and referenced the investigation in his letter to colleagues , which he posted on LinkedIn.
“For those who know me, you know I don’t shy away from tough fights. But I also know this is one I need to take on fully — outside of SentinelOne,” the letter read. “This will require my complete focus and energy. It’s a fight for democracy, for freedom of speech, and for the rule of law. I’m prepared to give it everything I’ve got.”
The Trump administration has also gone after at least three other Justice Department employees, firing them for separate reasons.
In April, Trump’s DOJ fired Erez Reuveni — an immigration lawyer who argued for the government in the mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — accusing him of sabotaging its legal case. Reuveni was initially placed on administrative leave and then fired after he expressed frustration with the government’s inability to provide answers to questions from a judge in the case.
As the Trump administration faced mounting scrutiny over its handling of documents related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, the Justice Department in July fired Maurene Comey , a federal prosecutor in the Epstein case and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who has been critical of Trump. James Comey was fired by Trump in his first term.
The Justice Department in July also fired prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace after she was chosen by federal judges in New Jersey to replace Alina Habba, Trump’s pick for US attorney in the state, whose interim appointment was set to expire. Following her firing, Grace posted a message on LinkedIn , in which she pushed back that politics played any part in her job performance and vowed to assume the position she was appointed to by the judges.
Two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were placed on administrative leave in July.
Both officials — Steve Volz, who heads NOAA’s satellites division, and Jeff Dillen, deputy NOAA general counsel — led the investigation into whether NOAA’s scientific integrity policies were violated during the so-called Sharpiegate scandal of Trump’s first term.
A copy of a letter informing Volz he was being placed on leave references an “investigation” into his “recent conduct,” though NOAA sources did not know what that may refer to. The letter came from acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm.
It is not clear if Dillen’s letter also referenced an investigation. The Sharpiegate scandal appears to be the only significant event that links the two men, though the personnel moves could be coincidental.
In 2019, Trump modified the National Weather Service’s forecast cone of Hurricane Dorian — with a sharpie — to suggest that the storm might hit Alabama.
Volz and Dillen’s investigation found that then-acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs and another NOAA official violated the agency’s scientific integrity policy by backing Trump’s hand-drawn version of the forecast. Jacobs has been nominated to become NOAA administrator in Trump’s current term.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Volz questioned the move to put him on leave, asking, “Why now?”
“Maybe the desire here is to get anybody who might slow down their ability to execute their plan out of the way. I think I’m one of those people,” he told the Post.
Trump has also sought retribution against two men connected to the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election: former FBI director James Comey and former CIA director John Brennan . Both are under investigation by the FBI.
Comey later testified to Congress that he orchestrated the leak of accounts of conversations with Trump because he thought it might lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor to lead the Russia election probe. On Sept. 25, a federal grand jury indicted Comey, charging him with two felony counts that go hand-in-hand: Obstruction of the congressional proceeding where he testified on September 30, 2020, and making a false statement to Congress during that testimony.
Meanwhile, Brennan — who was the CIA director under former President Barack Obama — told House investigators in 2017 that Russia “brazenly interfered” in US elections, including actively contacting members of Trump’s campaign. However, he stopped shy of dubbing it a “collusion.”
The investigation into Russian election interference ultimately did not find that Trump’s campaign or associates conspired with Russia or that Trump committed a crime. But the investigation also did not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice.
When news broke of the investigation, Brennan told MSNBC that he was not contacted by the FBI, Justice Department or CIA.
“I am clueless about what it is exactly that they may be investigating me for,” Brennan said.
Following a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July, Trump fired Erika McEntarfer , the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her, without evidence, of manipulating the monthly jobs reports for “political purposes.”
Meanwhile, the Department of Defense went after Jen Easterly , a former top national security official in the Biden administration. The Army secretary in July ordered the US Military Academy at West Point to rescind an offer of employment to Easterly after far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has a direct line to Trump, criticized her appointment.
Easterly responded in a LinkedIn post, saying the move was “a casualty of casually manufactured outrage that drowned out the quiet labor of truth and the steady pulse of integrity.”
“The Warrior Ethos was forged into me long ago, and it does not waver now,” she added.
Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse , who served as head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, was also fired. Sources told CNN that the DIA’s initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from US strikes angered Trump.
Since taking office, Trump has revoked security clearances for more than 100 former government officials, including many high-ranking members of the Biden administration.
Trump in February revoked former President Joe Biden’s security clearance, though former presidents typically do not have security clearances.
Former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former national security advisor Jake Sullivan and former US deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco have also had their security clearances revoked, with Trump arguing that it is “no longer in the national interest” for them to have access to classified information.
Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state and Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, also had her security clearance revoked.
New York AG Letitia James faced the same consequence, along with Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who led the hush money case against Trump.
The following Trump critics, who are under investigation, have also had their security clearances revoked: Bolton, Milley, Taylor and Krebs.
Similarly, former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger — the two Republicans who sat on the House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot — have lost their security clearances, as have some people involved in Trump’s first impeachment inquiry. That includes Alexander Vindman, a former top Ukraine expert for the National Security Council who was a witness in the inquiry; Fiona Hill, Trump’s former top Russia adviser who also testified; Mark Zaid, who represented the whistleblower whose complaint led to the inquiry; and Norman Eisen, who served as counsel to House Democrats during the inquiry.
Vindman said in a post on X , I’m not a weak-kneed billionaire or a massive spineless law firm, so I don’t care what noises @realDonaldTrump makes about a security clearance that hasn’t been active for five years.”
“Revoking my security clearance constitutes an attack on the rule of law and destroys decades of established due process precedent,” Zaid said in a statement to CNN.
Norm Eisen said in a post on X , “It’s like the third time (Trump’s) announced he’s revoking my security clearance … Who does he think I am, a big law firm or a billionaire who’s gonna back down? It just makes me file even more lawsuits!”
Kinzinger commented at the time on the revocation with a video on Instagram , saying: “Here’s the funny thing, dude, I retired a year ago from the military. I don’t even have a security clearance.” He captioned the post: “Living rent free in orange man’s head.”
Trump has also revoked the security clearances of Andrew Weissmann — a former prosecutor in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
A bulk of the revocations are tied to a 2020 letter arguing that emails from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” More than 50 former intelligence officials signed that letter and on his first day back in office, Trump revoked all their security clearances — though many of the former officials are long retired and did not hold active clearances. Those who signed the letter include Brennan, former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper, and former acting CIA directors John McLaughlin and Michael Morell.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, at Trump’s direction, issued another round of revocations in August, moving to cancel the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials . The group includes people who were involved in conducting an assessment of Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election as well as members of Biden’s National Security Council, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/kristi-noem-tsa-video,Video of Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for shutdown “rolling out” at TSA security checkpoints across the country,,,,CNN,"In an extraordinary effort to inject politics into millions of Americans’ travel experiences, the Trump administration plans to roll out a video at airports across the United States that will blame Democrats for lapses in Transportation Security Administration workers’ pay because of the government shutdown.
People waiting in airport security lines will now be met with a new video of the Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem addressing the shutdown.
“It is TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” she says. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
The video was first obtained by Fox News.
The Department of Homeland Security responded to CNN’s questions about the video in a statement that noted the “public service video is rolling out across the country,” then repeated the language in the video almost verbatim.
“We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel, and our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” the video concludes.
TSA checkpoints often include videos featuring government officials welcoming travelers and explanations of procedures, but they usually do not contain political messages."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/health/ultraprocessed-food-ban-california-wellness,California enacts nation’s first law to define and ban ultraprocessed foods,,,,CNN,"California made history Wednesday by enacting the first law in the United States to define and ultimately ban unhealthy ultraprocessed foods, or UPFs, from what’s projected to be over 1 billion meals served to California schoolchildren in the 2025-26 school year.
By signing the “Real Food, Healthy Kids Act” into law, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken control of a growing movement to reform the nation’s food supply. The state legislature passed the bill in mid-September.
On average, children in the United States get nearly two-thirds of their calories from ultraprocessed foods packed full of additives and high-calorie sugars, salt and fat, according to a recent CDC report .
Not only does the California legislation define ultraprocessed food — a task which most of the world has yet to accomplish — it requires public health officials and scientists to decide which UPFs are most harmful to human health. Any “ultraprocessed food of concern” would then be phased out of the school food supply.
California’s decisive action is a sharp contrast to the “Make American Healthy Again,” or MAHA, movement spearheaded by US Health and Human Services director Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“While folks in DC are commissioning reports and debating hypotheticals, California is leading with decisive action,” Jesse Gabriel, the Democratic California Assemblymember who introduced the bill, said in a press conference.
“Or to put it more bluntly, here in California, we are actually doing the work to protect our kids health, and we’ve been doing it since well before anyone had ever heard of the MAHA movement,” Gabriel added.
The MAHA Commission promised decisive action on ultraprocessed food by August of this year. However, the final report , released in September, only promised the government would “continue efforts” to define ultraprocessed foods.
“Unfortunately, the final MAHA report is all promises and has no teeth,” Barry Popkin, the W.R. Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health told CNN at the time .
“In my opinion, it shows the food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries got to the White House and won the day,” Popkin said.
That scenario could have happened in California as well, said Bernadette Del Chiaro, senior vice president for California at the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a health advocacy organization based in Washington, DC, that cosponsored the bill.
“There was very serious opposition. Industry always kicks and screams and fights like bloody hell to keep these bills from becoming law,” Del Chiaro told CNN. “Just the number of committees we had to go through to get the bill passed illustrates how much lobbying was going on.”
The final vote, however, told it all: Out of 120 California assemblymembers and senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties, only one voted no — a Republican from San Diego.
“We had broad bipartisan support because ultimately, this is coming from the grassroots up — from politicians hearing about these issues in their community and wanting to do something about it,” Del Chiaro said. “We’re in this moment where Americans are waking up to the fact that we have chemicals in everything — our food, our water and our air — and we need to do something about it.”
CNN reached out to the Consumer Brands Association, which represents major food manufacturers, but did not hear back before publication.
Chemicals used in many popular food and drink products now banned from California public schools
The “Real Food, Healthy Kids Act” specifically defines an ultraprocessed food as one that may contain such ingredients as nonnutritive sweeteners; high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar; additives such as emulsifiers, stabilizers and thickeners; flavor enhancers; a host of food dyes; and more.
The California law provides guidance on how much of an ingredient like sugar or salt can be in a food in order to be served to elementary and middle-school children, with a slightly different standard for high schoolers.
But not all ultraprocessed foods will be phased out of the state’s school supply, Gabriel told CNN.
“We can’t eliminate all ultraprocessed foods — we need them, we need the shelf stability, the safety, the convenience,” he said. “But the foods with the most harmful additives, foods that are linked to food addiction or cancer or diabetes or fatty liver disease, that’s the group of ultraprocessed foods we will phase out of our schools.”
An ultraprocessed food can also be banned for containing additives that have been banned, restricted or required to carry a warning by other local, state, federal or international jurisdictions, according to the law. (The European Union has taken action on various food dyes and other additives .)
Another red flag: Has the ultraprocessed food been modified to include high levels of sugar, salt or fat? (That’s a key way manufacturers design ultraprocessed foods to meet the “ bliss point ” human taste buds yearn for.)
Here are good and bad ultraprocessed foods, according to the American Heart Association
Eliminating ultraprocessed foods from the California school food supply is not going to be a quick process. In earlier iterations of the bill, regulators were required to take some actions in 2026. In the final law, the first regulation — requiring food vendors to report all ultraprocessed foods they will supply — is due on or before February 1, 2028. All ultraprocessed food of concern must be identified and out of schools by July 1, 2035.
There’s also a concern that California’s efforts could be derailed by a federal government controlled by Republicans.
“We are constantly concerned that Congress will fight to preempt our authority with some kind of watered down, weak federal effort,” Del Chiaro said. “There’s certainly members of Congress that are threatening that, right?
“But we had broad bipartisan support, and I would certainly hope that, politicians at the federal level see that we’re all on the same team. We’re on Team Public Health and Team Kids and I hope they will continue to let states be the laboratories of democracy that we are.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/sport/nba-lebron-james-lakers-sciatica,LeBron James to reportedly miss start of 2025-2026 NBA season due to sciatica,,,,CNN,"It won’t be an ideal start to LeBron James’ record 23rd NBA season after the 40-year-old superstar will miss opening night due to sciatica, according to multiple reports.
Per the reports, James will be re-evaluated in three to four weeks.
ESPN’s Shams Charania was first to report the news.
CNN has reached out to the Lakers for comment.
The NBA’s all-time leading scorer has not been a full participant in Lakers practice since the opening of training camp earlier this month and has also missed the team’s first two preseason games due to what head coach JJ Redick said is a nerve irritation in his glute.
LeBron James, Taylor Swift and the fans who are being kept on the edge of their seats
On Thursday, Redick said that James is “on his own timeline” ahead of the Lakers’ opening game of the regular season on October 21 against Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors at the Crypto.com Arena.
Sciatica is pain that originates in the spine and radiates down the back of the leg.
James, who has been the subject of retirement rumors for much of the last year, is entering a record-setting 23rd season in the league.
Last season, James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 70 games.
The four-time NBA champion was non-committal about his future following the Lakers’ first-round loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the NBA playoffs earlier this year.
“I don’t know. I don’t have the answer to that,” James told reporters. “Something I’ll sit down with my family, my wife and my support group and kind of just talk through it and see what happens and just have a conversation with myself on how long I want to continue to play. I don’t know the answer to that right now, to be honest, so we’ll see.”
In June, James reportedly picked up his $52.6 million option to return for an eighth season with the Lakers.
James is a 21-time All-Star and four-time league MVP and has scored a record 42,184 regular-season points, and 50,473 in the regular season and playoffs combined.
James entered the NBA as an 18-year-old after being selected No. 1 in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He turns 41 in December."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/gop-is-springing-leaks-in-its-shutdown-strategy,GOP is springing leaks in its shutdown strategy,,,,CNN,"At the start of the government shutdown last week, it was Democrats who looked like they wouldn’t be united. Right off the bat, they lost the votes of three members of their Senate caucus. They had folded just before the last shutdown, and it was an inauspicious start to this one.
A lot can change in a week.
Yes, those three members continue to vote with Republicans. But otherwise, it’s largely Republicans who are springing leaks in their shutdown strategy.
Repeatedly in recent days, GOP members have stepped forward and undermined their side’s negotiating posture on key issues.
These voices are largely coming from the House, which has already passed a Republican-led short-term funding bill, whereas the Senate is where the action is right now. But their comments run counter to the party’s messaging as Senate Republicans still need several more Democrats to sign onto the package.
Most prominent among them is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who seems to be basking in sticking it to her party leaders right now. Starting with her comments Monday signaling her support for Democrats’ policy demand – an extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits – the Georgia congresswoman has unleashed a torrent of unhelpful comments for GOP leaders.
While GOP leaders have said they’ll negotiate on Obamacare after Democrats vote to reopen the government, Greene has basically argued: Why wait?
She’s also suggested GOP leaders haven’t approached that important Obamacare issue with any particular urgency, despite the potential for huge increases in premiums for her constituents and even her adult children.
“Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene posted on X on Monday. (House Speaker Mike Johnson said Greene simply wasn’t familiar with the work leaders are doing on these issues.)
While GOP leaders blame Democrats for demanding something extra as part of a shutdown deal – which is almost always a losing proposition – Greene said she’s “actually putting the blame on the speaker and Leader [John] Thune in the Senate. This should not be happening.”
And on Thursday, she played into another major Democratic argument – that Johnson isn’t seating Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who was elected more than two weeks ago, because he doesn’t want her to be the decisive 218th signature on the discharge petition to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. (Greene is one of four Republicans who has signed the petition.)
“I can’t conclusively say if that’s why the House isn’t in session,” Greene said. She added: “But the House should be in session. There is a new Democrat that’s been elected that does deserve to be sworn in. … If it’s to avoid the discharge petition, why drag this out? That’s going to have 218 signatures.”
Johnson has said Grijalva hasn’t been seated because the House is on recess. But as CNN’s Manu Raju has noted, the House swore in two special-election-winning Florida Republicans earlier this year during what’s known as a “pro forma” session.
Greene isn’t the only one bucking leadership and calling for the House to return to Washington.
Johnson has said it’s not necessary because the chamber already passed a clean seven-week continuing resolution that Senate leaders are demanding Democrats support. But some have stepped forward to say the House should be working.
Rep. Kevin Kiley of California responded to Johnson’s comments by saying the House should be working to pass a full budget.
“The Speaker shouldn’t even think about cancelling session for a third straight week,” Kiley said on X .
And Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia has called on Johnson to bring back members of Congress to pass legislation ensuring the military members get their paychecks before those paychecks are missed next week.
“Military pay should not be held hostage due to Washington’s dysfunction!” Kiggans posted on X .
Johnson has rejected this , again pointing out Senate Democrats could ensure those paychecks if they pass the continuing resolution. It’s clear he’d like to use that as leverage. But Kiggans is suggesting it shouldn’t be used as such. And her legislation has been co-sponsored by more than 100 House Republicans .
Greene, too, said Thursday on CNN that leadership shouldn’t “dangle” issues like that as leverage.
Democrats, meanwhile, insist that growing pressures – like the military missing an upcoming paycheck – won’t cause them to throw in the towel next week.
GOP senators also continue to push back on another leverage point for GOP leaders and the Trump administration: the threat of government cuts.
Trump said Thursday, “We’re only going to cut Democrat programs.” But a number of Republicans have cautioned the administration against that approach or even large cuts, period, warning it would squander the GOP’s political advantages.
“There should be no targeting of anyone,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told CNN on Thursday. “We don’t need to unnecessarily target any other areas more than others.”
And then there’s a particularly vivid scene on Wednesday that really ties all of this together.
GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York got into a brief confrontation with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in the halls of Congress. Lawler’s gambit: Asking Jeffries to sign on to a brief, one-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies.
“You’re embarrassing yourself right now,” Jeffries told Lawler. “You’re chasing clout.”
But there was one main problem with Lawler’s gambit: The bill he was asking Jeffries to sign onto doesn’t have the support of GOP leadership. Republican leaders haven’t supported anything specific when it comes to extending the subsidies. His bill has just more than a dozen GOP co-sponsors, less than 10% of House Republicans.
It was a remarkable scene. While GOP leaders are trying to hold a hard line, Lawler was making a big show of offering a concession they don’t even support.
All of it suggests there is some real reluctance about the GOP’s firm posture here. Democrats, meanwhile, are projecting more unity , at least at this early juncture.
That could change, especially next week as the military-paycheck deadline looms.
But the more Republicans spring these leaks, it’s likely to add to Democrats’ resolve."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/health-trump-semi-annual-exam,Trump says he’ll undergo routine ‘semi-annual’ exam during planned Walter Reed trip,,,,CNN,"President Donald Trump will travel to Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday, making an unusual return to the health facility for the second time this year.
The trip, which the White House initially described as a “yearly” checkup , comes just six months after Trump underwent a regular physical that his doctor referred to then as an “annual” examination .
Trump later clarified that his latest trip would be for a routine “semi-annual” exam, insisting he remains healthy and is simply trying to keep it that way.
“I think I’m in great shape, but I’ll let you know,” he said from the Oval Office on Thursday. “When I’m around, I like to check. Always be early, it’s a lesson for a lot of people.”
The visit nevertheless marks a departure from the traditional presidential cadence of undergoing a single comprehensive exam per year.
And it follows the White House’s disclosure over the summer that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. The condition is common in older people and easily manageable, but had sparked speculation about his health after photos showed swelling in his legs.
Trump, who at 79 is one of the oldest presidents in US history, has also faced scrutiny over regular bruising on his right hand that he’s appeared at times to cover up with heavy makeup. The White House physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has attributed it to a combination of “frequent handshaking” and aspirin use, which can increase bruising.
“Certainly, as we all get older, we often need more than one visit with our doctor in a year because we have various chronic problems that are being managed,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and an emergency physician. “(Trump) gets a higher standard of care than most of the rest of us.”
Presidents have access to basic medical care at the White House. But for more extensive exams and procedures, they traditionally go to Walter Reed.
The White House offered no details about the checkup beyond its initial announcement, which said that Trump would also use the opportunity to meet and speak to troops on site. He’s expected to return to the White House afterward, ahead of an anticipated trip to the Middle East over the weekend to hail the first phase of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas.
“We’re planning on leaving sometime Sunday, and I look forward it,” Trump said. “Everybody’s celebrating.”
The president has frequently cited his medical evaluations as evidence of his vigor, boasting repeatedly about a cognitive test that he claims he aced. Trump’s fitness also played an outsized role on the campaign trail, where he often pointed to his exam results as a contrast to swirling questions about then-President Joe Biden’s health and mental acuity.
Yet like most American presidents, Trump has also been selective in the past about sharing the full state of his health, perhaps most notably seeking to conceal the seriousness of his Covid-19 symptoms after contracting the disease in October 2020 and needing to be hospitalized at Walter Reed for multiple days.
President Trump has common form of heart disease
Trump’s post-annual exam memos during his first term also routinely featured over-the-top praise for his health, with then-presidential physician Dr. Ronny Jackson at one point highlighting his “good genes” and routinely portraying him as remarkably fit.
The White House called on Jackson again in recent months to bolster its dismissals of scrutiny around Trump’s hand bruise, issuing a statement from the now-Texas congressman that dubbed him “the healthiest president this nation has ever seen.”
By contrast, Barbabella’s report following Trump’s first physical in April offered a straightforward rundown of his condition — for the most part. After declaring him “fully fit” to execute his presidential duties, Barbabella concluded that “President Trump remains in excellent health.”
As evidence of that well-being, he cited Trump’s “frequent victories in golf events.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/shutdown-air-traffic-controllers,"As the shutdown wears on, Transportation secretary threatens to fire ‘problem children’ air traffic controllers ‘lashing out’",,,,CNN,"As the ninth day of the government shutdown wears on, the focus is on how many air traffic controllers show up to work tonight.
The Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages for controllers dealing with airspace in 11 different places Thursday evening, according to a publicly available planning document.
The control tower at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport will have fewer than normal controllers from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET along with Bradley International Airport in Connecticut from 4:25 p.m to 8:45 p.m. ET and Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport in Virginia, from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.
Two different parts of the airspace controlled by the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center will be short-staffed from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and two parts of the Albuquerque center will be short staffed between 7:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. ET. The Washington center, located in Virginia will not have a normal number of staff from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and the Indianapolis center will be short staffed 12:30 a.m. ET and 6:30 a.m. ET. These areas usually deal with planes flying at higher altitudes.
Newark Approach control, which handles flights approaching or departing the airport, will be short staffed from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET. Delays of nearly 90 minutes are expected. And Orlando International Airport Approach will be understaffed from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.
Earlier Thursday, a facility in Fort Worth, Texas was also short-staffed for about an hour.
The cause of the staffing problems was not immediately apparent, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said early Thursday on Fox Business a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work.
Every staffing problem reported does not always cause delays since controllers can take other actions, like routing flights to airspace with a normal complement of controllers.
Wednesday six FAA facilities had staffing shortages, including the control towers at Denver International and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where about a quarter of the flights were delayed.
“It’s a small fraction of people who don’t come to work that can create this massive disruption, and that’s what you’re seeing rippling through our skies today,” Duffy said.
He said normally about 5% of delays are caused by short staffing, but now it’s more than half of the delays.
“I think what’s happening here, 90% of the controllers, they show up, they come to work, but 10% of them are lashing out,” Duffy said, blaming Democrats in Washington for the shutdown.
Monday night, the Hollywood Burbank Airport control tower closed when too many controllers there called out sick. Tuesday, flights in Nashville were delayed and part of the air traffic control operations had to be shifted to another facility across the state when workers took unscheduled time off.
If controllers keep not showing up, Duffy will fire them, he said.
“If we have a continual small subset of controllers that don’t show up to work… they’re the problem children,” he said. “We need more controllers, but we need the best and the brightest, the dedicated controllers, and if we have some on our staff that aren’t dedicated like we need, we’re going to let them go.”
Controllers are considered essential employees and have to work during the government shutdown, despite not being paid.
It is against the law for controllers to strike or take actions like sickouts, and the air traffic controllers’ union has urged members to keep working during the shutdown.
“There are processes and procedures in place to deal with the inappropriate use of sick leave,” the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said responding to Duffy’s threats.
Tuesday is the next payday, and controllers will only get a partial check for hours worked before the shutdown.
The government shutdown has not had a “significant impact” on Delta Air Lines’ operations, CEO Ed Bastian told Brad Smith in an interview on “CNN Headline Express.”
There were barely any flight cancellations the first week of October, with Delta completing nearly 100% of its flight schedule, Bastian said. Delays were also infrequent, with the airline running on time for 90% of flights.
“As everyone’s well aware, the air traffic control system is already understaffed, so I think it’s difficult to speculate at this point in time, ‘is it more understaffed than normal?’” Bastian said. “We’ll keep our customers posted as always, but I do not anticipate any meaningful issues here.”
Southwest Airlines, which has a large operation in Nashville, Burbank and several of the other cities hard hit by recent staffing problems, said it is monitoring the situation.
Southwest must remain “vigilant in ensuring operational reliability” as air traffic controller staffing is “dynamic and could change rapidly at any ATC facility,” airline leaders wrote Wednesday in a company-wide memo obtained by CNN.
“To date, while we’ve experienced a few manageable delays and cancellations related to the shortages,” it said. “We’ll continue to adjust our schedule, as needed and under the direction of the FAA, to help maintain the safety of our customers and employees.”
United Airlines and American Airlines declined to comment, directing CNN to the industry group Airlines for America.
“When federal employees who manage air traffic, inspect aircraft and secure our nation’s aviation system are furloughed or working without pay, the entire industry and millions of Americans feel the strain,” the group said. “Aviation is the safest mode of transportation, but to maintain that the system may need to slow down.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/dominion-voting-systems-bought-election-ballots,"Former GOP election official buys Dominion Voting Systems, says he’ll push for paper ballots",,,,CNN,"Dominion Voting Systems, the election vendor that was falsely accused of rigging the 2020 election, is being sold and rebranded as Liberty Vote effective immediately.
Scott Leiendecker, the founder of a Missouri-based election technology company who previously served as the Republican director for the St. Louis City Board of Elections, purchased the company this week for an undisclosed sum, according to a press release.
“As of today, Dominion is gone. Liberty Vote assumes full ownership and operational control,” the press release reads.
Leiendecker says he wants to use the renamed company to restore public confidence in the US electoral process. Liberty Now also vows to be bipartisan as it works to reshape Dominion’s image. Dominion’s election products were used by millions of US voters across 27 states last year.
Dominion’s founder and CEO, John Poulos, confirmed in a one-sentence statement provided to CNN on Thursday that, “Liberty Vote has acquired Dominion Voting Systems.”
The company’s new owner laid out four goals, many of which align with the Trump administration, that they argue will restore trust in US elections,  the main being a heavy emphasis on using paper ballots.
“Liberty Vote is committed to delivering election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted,” Leiendecker says.
The sale of Dominion comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted he plans to overhaul America’s election systems, from wanting to move the US to all-paper ballots, require voter identification in all elections, and restrict mail-in voting. The president has promised to carry out those goals through executive orders, something he does not have explicit authority to do, as he seeks to change election laws that he has falsely blamed for his 2020 election loss.
Liberty Vote also plans on ensuring the company is “100% American owned,” including all domestic staffing and software development, the release states. Dominion was founded as a Canadian company with offices in Toronto, Denver, and Dallas. The new company plans to continue to have a presence in Canada, however, a source familiar with the plans said.
The press release from Liberty Vote references some buzzwords that have been championed by the pro-Trump “election integrity” community.
For instance, its emphasis on increasing the use of “hand-marked paper ballots” aligns with Trump’s longstanding push to move to 100% paper ballots. This talking point has perplexed election officials for years, because, as CNN has previously reported , more than 98% of American voters already live in jurisdictions that produce fully auditable paper trails.
The Liberty Vote announcement also says its actions will be in “compliance with President Trump’s executive order,” signed earlier this year, on election integrity. Parts of that order have already been blocked by a federal judge, and leading election experts have said the order is likely unconstitutional.
The new company says one of its other priorities will be to facilitate third-party auditing of their election systems. Right-wing “election integrity” activists have promoted outside audits, most famously in Arizona after 2020, as a way to hunt for supposed fraud. Nonpartisan studies have repeatedly found that voter fraud is extraordinarily rare in US elections — and most states already conduct internal post-election audits.
“This announcement raises a lot of questions, questions that I’m sure a lot of states with current Dominion contracts are going to want answers to,” said David Becker, an election industry expert who advises officials from both parties and runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.
The company Leiendecker previously founded, KNOWiNK, is one of the “known and established companies” in the small voting technology industry, Becker said.
“They are primarily in the business of providing electronic poll books and voter database systems,” Becker said of KNOWiNK. “They’ve worked across the country, with red states, blue states, red counties and blue counties.”
The company is also being repped by the Logan Circle Group, which vows to fight for “America First” and conservative values. LCG Media’s website features several images of MAGA figures, such as President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene former GOP congressman Matt Gaetz, among others.
Dominion was a little-known election vendor before 2020. But after Trump lost the election that year, the company found itself at the center of baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud, peddled by Trump’s allies.
The baseless theory claimed Dominion voting machines used Venezuelan election-rigging software to flip millions of votes from Trump to Democratic nominee Joe Biden in battleground states, handing the election to Biden.
The theory was swiftly and thoroughly debunked. Still, it was repeatedly promoted by Trump , his 2020 campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, outside allies like Mike Lindell , and supportive personalities at right-wing media outlets , like Fox News, Newsmax and One America News.
Dominion sued many of these outlets and figures for defamation in 2021.
Fox News famously paid Dominion more than $787 million in 2023 to end its case – the largest publicly known defamation settlement involving a media company in US history. Newsmax settled its case in August for $67 million.
In the past month, Dominion resolved its cases with OAN, Powell and Giuliani , with settlements that haven’t been made public. The company didn’t publicly explain why it decided to settle these cases in recent weeks.
As of Thursday, Dominion still has pending defamation lawsuits against Lindell and another notorious 2020 election denier, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne , who both deny wrongdoing.
CNN has reached out to Dominion’s lawyers for comment.
Before Thursday, Dominion’s largest investor was Staple Street Capital, a private equity fund. Staple Street thought Dominion was worth $80 million when it acquired the company in 2018, according to court filings, and it believed the company was valued at $225 million before the 2020 election."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff,"Trust in federal health leadership is failing under RFK Jr., new poll finds",,,,CNN,"Most of the American public does not approve of the way Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running the nation’s health agencies, according to a new KFF poll , and there’s an erosion of trust in reliable vaccine information from the federal government in particular.
Nearly 6 in 10 adults in the United States say they disapprove of Kennedy’s overall job performance as secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, KFF found.
Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to disapprove of Kennedy overall – 87% versus 26% – but there’s division even within Kennedy’s signature Make America Healthy Again movement, which is mostly composed of Republicans.
Overall, about 4 in 10 adults say they consider themselves supporters of the MAHA movement, according to the KFF survey. But even within the movement, about 30% say they disapprove of the way Kennedy is handling his role as HHS secretary.
The MAHA agenda is generally focused on food, the environment and pharmaceuticals – especially vaccines. Under Kennedy’s leadership, there has been a complete overhaul of the independent committee that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine guidance and major changes made to federal vaccine recommendations.
But the public dislikes the way Kennedy is handling vaccine policy even more than they do his overall job performance, KFF found; 62% of adults overall and 35% of those who consider themselves part of the MAHA movement say they disapprove at least somewhat.
Low-income families are still waiting on Covid-19 vaccines for kids, but states say they’re coming
And public trust in the CDC is now the lowest it’s been since the Covid-19 pandemic began, according to KFF. Only half of adults in the US say they trust the agency to provide reliable vaccine information, down from 57% in July and 63% in September 2024. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to trust the CDC, but trust even among Democrats has dropped significantly – tumbling 24 percentage points since 2023.
Instead, the public is more likely to turn to other groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association for vaccine information, with about two-thirds of adults saying they trust these groups for reliable vaccine information.
Amid the federal vaccine policy upheaval, these groups and other major organizations ha﻿ve broken with federal guidance and published their own vaccine recommendations – and some states have formally adopted these recommendations , too.
According to KFF, about 45% of the American public says they trust their state government for reliable vaccine information – lower than trust in the professional groups but about 10 percentage points more than trust expressed for Kennedy.
“It’s encouraging if far from ideal that as trust in our nation’s scientific agencies crumbles, the public does trust the professional associations who have stepped forward,” KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said.
In a statement, HHS contended that public health institutions struggled with trust even before Kennedy took the helm.
“The Secretary remains committed to rebuilding public trust in HHS and its entities through transparency and gold standard science,” the statement said.
The new poll found that doctors remain the most trusted source of vaccine information, with more than 80% of adults saying they trust their physician “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”
The findings are based on responses from a nationally representative sample of more than 1,300 US adults. Survey participants were polled during the last week of September, starting the day after the Trump administration held a major news conference about autism and Tylenol.
At that briefing, President Donald Trump announced that the US Food and Drug Administration would notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.
In doctors’ offices, the consequences of Trump’s comments on Tylenol and vaccines are immediately clear
KFF found that most US adults had heard the claim that taking Tylenol during pregnancy can cause autism in children and that many were uncertain about its validity.
Less than 5% said they thought the claim was “definitely true,” and about a third said they thought the claim was “definitely false” – but most fell somewhere in the middle, with an even split between those who thought it was “probably true” and “probably false.”
Democrats were about five times more likely than Republicans to say the claim was “definitely false.” But a majority of women – including more than a third of Democratic women and about two-thirds of Republican women – expressed some uncertainty about the validity of the claim, KFF found."

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/business/taylor-swift-new-album-business-nightcap,Taylor Swift’s new album is her novelty Oreo play,,,,CNN,"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .
No one needs another take on Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl . We live in a surfeit of TLOAS takes. But this is a ~business~ story, I promise.
First things first: Many critics have deemed Swift’s 12th studio album a miss, and I’m not going to sit here and tell the critics they’re wrong (at least, not about TLOAS ). I can squint and point out the album’s gems — I think “Wood” is fun, actually — but that kind of analysis is best reserved for my music-reviewing brethren.
My job here is to point out why I think TLOAS is a savvy business play masquerading as Millennial cringe. In short: It’s novelty Oreos.
ICYMI: Five years ago, the New York Times’ Jonah E. Bromwich wrote that those limited-edition Oreos — with weird flavors like Root Beer Float or PB&J or Key Lime Pie — are all part of a clever marketing strategy by the cookie brand:
“Novelty Oreos sell reasonably well … But the sales are not the point. Novelty Oreos… play a much purer role: They help drive consumers back to milk’s alleged favorite, the 108-year-old paterfamilias, the plain old Oreo. In other words, the new flavors function as advertisements for the original.”
You take a weird flavor that is decidedly not for everyone and chuck it into the world like chum. “Piña Colada Oreo Thins,” to a reasonable person, sound certifiably insane. If you were to walk by such an abomination in the grocery store you might shake your head and say, Dear God, Oreo has lost its way. Might as well buy a box of the original recipe now while you still can.
It is a madman theory of marketing, and it works .
Bromwich writes that over a three-year period when sales of novelty Oreos were up 12%, sales of the classic were up nearly 22%.
Finally, everyone can say bad things about Taylor Swift
Showgirl is Taylor Swift’s Piña Colada Oreo. We’re not suggesting that Taylor would put out an album that was less than her best on purpose, but it hardly matters. The result is still a weird Oreo, and a weird Oreo can be — when you’re as successful as Taylor Swift — great for the brand and the bottom line.
Because who makes money when you’re done giving Showgirl a try and decide it’s time to revisit Evermore ? Miss Taylor Alison Swift.
Earlier this year, Swift acquired her entire music catalog outright, reclaiming her masters from Shamrock Capital, the private equity firm that bought the recordings from Swift’s first music label. That means all the revenue from all her past work — album sales, merchandise, films, the works — goes into her pocket.
“Unlike most celebrities,” my colleague Ramishah Maruf writes, “Swift has made lucrative business dealings a part of her persona, positioning herself at the vanguard of the long narrative in the music business that unseen executives received much of the money actually generated by artists.”
Any time Swift releases a new album, Ramishah notes, streaming of her previous work (good ol’ plain or Double Stuf Oreos) also spikes.
To be sure, Showgirl is no commercial flop, even if the critical reception is mixed. As of Thursday, it was closing in on the modern-era record for album sales in a single week, potentially dethroning Adele’s 2015 masterwork, 25 , according to Billboard (which notes the modern era data date to 1991). The Swifties are clearly not letting withering critiques from The Standard (“I was beginning to wonder if I was accidentally listening to a parody album hallucinated by some porn-addled AI”) or Pitchfork (“ Showgirl sounds like much of the pop music you have heard over the past 10 years and throughout your lifetime) spoil their fun.
Addressing the mixed reviews, Swift offered the kind of “all press is good press” reasoning you’d expect from a billionaire brand executive.
“The rule of show business is, if it’s the first week of my album release, and you are saying either my name or my album title, you’re helping,” she told podcast host Zane Lowe this week. “I know what I made. I know I adore it, and I know that on the theme of what the Showgirl is, all of this is part of it.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/trump-icebreakers-arctic,Trump strikes deal for icebreaker ships as competition grows in the Arctic,,,,CNN,"The US Coast Guard is buying four icebreaker ships from Finland, further bolstering America’s ability to put military assets in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China’s influence in the region is growing — and as experts have worried the US is not moving quickly enough.
The agreement, formally unveiled Thursday to coincide with a White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, is part of a larger deal to use “Finnish expertise” to construct up to seven additional icebreakers in US shipyards, a White House official told CNN. The up to 11 total medium icebreakers are expected to cost around $6.1 billion, the official added, with the goal of the first being delivered by 2028.
“The cooperation benefits both countries, Finland and the United States,” Stubb said in a post on X on Thursday, noting that he is “proud that Finnish arctic expertise is appreciated and trusted.”
The Coast Guard, which operates American icebreakers, commissioned its third icebreaker into service in August this year — the first acquired by the service in more than 25 years.
“What you’re doing is you’re going to be teaching us about the icebreaker business,” Trump said when reporters were invited into the Oval Office for a segment of the White House meeting. “By the time we finish, we’re going to make them maybe better than you, but at least as well, but probably not better, but at least as well.”
Stubbs noted during the meeting that Trump had raised the issue of icebreakers when they first talked months ago.
“I remember the first conversation we had, you know, you mentioned the fact that Russia has 40 and you need to start ramping this up,” he said. “And this is an indication that we’re going to do it and we’re going to do it together.”
Finland’s expertise in the Arctic — a significantly strategic important region for the United States and for NATO more broadly — was a key benefit to having Finland join NATO in 2023, Iris Ferguson, formerly the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Arctic and global resilience under the Biden administration, told CNN.
“The Arctic know-how, the border with Russia, the knowledge of Russia and their intentions and motivations, how they’ve strategically planned not only around capabilities like icebreakers, but also ground warfare, cyber warfare — they bring a lot of capabilities to bear that are useful for the Alliance and for the United States in the Arctic and more broadly,” Ferguson, who is currently a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.
Ferguson said the two older US icebreakers – a heavy icebreaker and a medium icebreaker — are often in and out of maintenance.
China, meanwhile, has five medium icebreakers, Ferguson said, and Russia has “the most icebreakers of any nation” with eight nuclear heavy icebreakers and dozens more medium style vessels. Stubbs put the total at 40 during the oval office meeting.
The push to increase the US’ presence in the Arctic has been top of mind for years, particularly as China and Russia have turned their attentio n to the region. The Pentagon’s 2024 Arctic Strategy noted that major geopolitical changes – including the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO and growing collaboration between Russia and China – are demanding a strategy shift from the US.
“This increasingly accessible region is becoming a venue for strategic competition, and the United States must stand ready to meet the challenge alongside Allies and partners,” then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote in the strategy report.
The US has a number of military bases in the Arctic, including joint Army-Air Force base Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson which is a strategically critical base for the US military in the Pacific, Army base Fort Wainwright, Eielson Air Force Base, Space Force base Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, and several Coast Guard facilities.
Ferguson said that the attention from Trump on the icebreaker issue and the Arctic more broadly is “a really big deal” for a region that can often be overlooked by Washington-based officials. Still, she said, there is more work to be done to ensure recent efforts materialize and are effective.
“I think the challenge will be in implementation. It’s going to be really hard to have the right personnel to ensure that budgets don’t just wildly explode with timelines,” she said, “because we haven’t done this recently.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/business/irs-inflation-tax-brackets-standard-deduction,IRS makes changes that will affect your taxes this year and next,,,,CNN,"The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments it is making to a host of line items on your federal tax return for this year and next. Those updates are the result of changes in inflation but also due to provisions in the new tax law enacted in July.
How the adjustments will affect you has everything to do with what deductions you take and what your taxable income will be.
But, generally speaking, “many taxpayers will see modest ‘relief’ simply because the deductions and thresholds move upward. Inflation will take less of a bite,” said Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals.
Among the changes are:
Most filers claim the standard deduction, and they do so because it exceeds the value of the deductions they would otherwise take if they itemized .
The increases in the standard deduction by 2026 “will shift more income into the ‘zero bracket’ — (meaning it will not) be taxed because the deduction covers more,” O’Saben said.
Who will — and won’t — benefit from the bigger SALT deduction
For tax year 2025, returns for which will be due in April of next year, the new tax law raised the standard deduction to $15,750 for single filers, up from the $15,000 that had previously been scheduled. For married couples filing jointly, it will be $31,500, up from $30,000. And for heads of households, their standard deduction will be $23,625, up from $22,500.
From there, for tax year 2026, the IRS is adjusting the standard deduction for inflation — something it does every year. As a result, the standard will rise to $16,100 for single filers; $32,200 for joint filers; and $24,150 for heads of households.
The IRS also made inflation adjustments for 2026 to the income ranges that apply to each of the seven federal income tax rates. As the IRS has explained, “When your income jumps to a higher tax bracket, you don’t pay the higher rate on your entire income. You pay the higher rate only on the part that’s in the new tax bracket.”
The adjustments are not uniform — some ranges increased by roughly 3.9% while others increased by about 2.3% relative to this year. “The uneven increases are normal artifacts of the IRS’s inflation adjustment methodology — not a policy choice to favor one income level over another,” O’Saben said.
In 2026, you will pay:
The EITC is an especially valuable credit for low-income households. Credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the taxes you owe. And, since it is a refundable credit, it can increase your refund if you don’t have much or any income tax liability.
The IRS is increasing the value of the credit for next year. For instance, eligible tax filers with three or more children may claim a maximum of $8,231, up from $8,046 this year.
(You can find more information here on these and other adjustments the IRS is making for 2026.)"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/economy/bessent-peso-argentina,Bessent says US purchased pesos and finalized framework for $20 billion lifeline for Argentina,,,,CNN,"The Trump administration has finalized plans to provide a $20 billion lifeline to Argentina, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday via social media. Additionally, the United States “directly” purchased Argentine pesos, Bessent said, a rare move that marks the latest step in an attempt to stabilize the country’s financial market.
Bessent did not specify how many pesos the United States had purchased.
Representatives from the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
“The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,” Bessent wrote.
The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent announced is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity.
The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he’ll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month.
Trump has praised the chainsaw-wielding libertarian and endorsed his reelection.
But the Trump administration’s attempt to rescue Milei’s economy has been met with some criticism , given Trump preaches an “America First” agenda.
Bessent defended the administration’s move, saying, “Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity. The international community — including @IMFNews — is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly.”
This is a developing story and will be updated."

“Ethan is alert, responsive and able to communicate. We are thankful for the efforts, thoughts and prayers of so many people and ask that you continue to support Ethan and his family as this process continues,” the Florida State Seminoles said in a statement.
Pritchard was at the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital and will continue his recovery at Brooks Rehabilitation in Jacksonville, according to the team.
The freshman’s teammates and coaching staff joined him at the hospital Thursday and applauded Pritchard as he was released, as seen in videos on social media.
Four arrests made in connection with the shooting of FSU linebacker Ethan Pritchard, authorities say
Pritchard’s father, Earl Pritchard, thanked the Seminoles for their support, including head coach Mike Norvell, who was described as a “constant presence”.
“Coach Norvell has checked in every day and has been a constant presence visiting us here at the hospital, and his players and staff have continued to make us feel part of the team. I can’t fully express how much those moments have meant to me and Ethan,” Earl Pritchard said in Thursday’s statement.
The linebacker’s dad also thanked the doctors, nurses and all those who have helped play a part in Pritchard’s recovery so far.
“My heart is filled with gratitude for the outpouring of support for so many people, and I’m so appreciative for every single one of you,” Pritchard continued.
“Ethan has a long journey ahead of him, but I know he will continue to fight and he will do so with the full support of our FSU and Seminole County families and all who have been impacted by his story.”
The Seminoles player was shot August 31 while inside a vehicle outside apartments in Havana, according to the Gadsden County Sheriff’s Office.
Gadsden County Sheriff Morris Young said authorities believe Pritchard’s shooting was a case of mistaken identity.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/robert-roberson-execution-stay,Robert Roberson: Death row inmate’s execution halted by Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,,,,CNN,"A Texas court has again granted a stay of execution to death row inmate Robert Roberson , who has long claimed he is innocent in the murder of his 2-year-old daughter Nikki Curtis, saying his conviction based on a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome was flawed.
The ruling Thursday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals halts Roberson’s execution scheduled to take place October 16, which his attorneys have said would be the first in the US based on an allegation of shaken baby syndrome.
The appeals court sent Roberson’s case back to his trial court for further review after years of unsuccessful appeals by the inmate and his attorneys. Ahead of his last execution date last October, state and federal courts, including the US Supreme Court, declined to stop his execution, and the Texas parole board rejected his plea for clemency.
In a death row interview with CNN Wednesday, Roberson again said he was innocent, but that he was at peace thanks to his faith.
“I’m not scared to die, but I’m not ready to die yet, you know,” he said.
“No matter what happens, I’m going home to a free world,” Roberson said. “I’m going home to be with the Lord.”
Texas prison officials say the unit warden delivered the news to Roberson shortly after the court ruled to halt the upcoming execution.
The order Thursday says the court found Roberson satisfied his claim that he should get relief under the state’s 2013 “junk science” law , which allows people to challenge their convictions if there is new scientific evidence.
In sending the case back to Roberson’s trial court for review, the appeals court cited a ruling it delivered last year, when it granted a new trial to a man, Andrew Roark, who was convicted of injury to a child based on a similar allegation of shaken baby syndrome. In that case, the court found scientific evidence had evolved and that it was “more likely than not” Roark, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison, would not have been convicted.
There remains consensus among pediatricians that the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome – now considered a subset of abusive head trauma – is legitimate. But Roberson’s supporters argue there are other explanations for Nikki’s death that don’t involve abuse: Shifts in the understanding of the causes of symptoms Nikki displayed shortly before her death, along with mounting new evidence, prove his innocence or at least warrant a new trial, they say.
On Thursday, Roberson’s attorney celebrated the ruling, but acknowledged there is still work to be done.
“We have won a battle, but we have certainly not won the war,” Gretchen Sween told reporters. “But quite literally, our Robert lives to fight another day, and that really is a triumph.”
Brian Wharton joins The Lead
Former detective asks Texas officials to spare life of death row inmate whose arrest he ordered in 2002
Roberson’s execution last year was only stopped following a remarkable maneuver from a group of state lawmakers, who subpoenaed the inmate’s testimony , prompting the Texas Supreme Court to issue a temporary stay. In the year since, Roberson and his attorneys had hoped to secure a new trial, but a new execution date was set even as appeals remained pending.
State Rep. Brian Harrison, a Republican who orchestrated the House committee subpoena last year, commended the Texas appeals court judges, stressing his belief that Roberson has “never been given a fair trial.”
“It is most incumbent on those of us who support capital punishment to ensure that potentially innocent people are never subject to it,” Harrison said on X .
“I will not stop fighting for justice and to ensure my children and the next generation do not inherit a state where the government can deprive Texans of life and liberty absent due process and fair trials.”
The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton took over representation of the state in Roberson’s proceedings this summer and has been fighting for the execution to proceed. In a statement last year, his office accused “a coalition of activists and State legislators” of “interfering with the justice system.”
“They have attempted to mislead the public by falsely claiming that Roberson was unfairly convicted through ‘junk science’ concerning ‘shaken baby syndrome,’” the statement said.
CNN has reached out to the office and that of Gov. Greg Abbott for comment.
Roberson’s case dates back to January 2002, when he brought his daughter to a Palestine, Texas, hospital. Doctors determined Nikki to be the victim of abuse and transferred her to a hospital in Dallas, where she was later taken off life support.
“That changed my life forever, you know, when I lost her,” Roberson told CNN Wednesday. “And I don’t wish that even on my worst enemy.”
Roberson told investigators he and Nikki had fallen asleep the night before in the same bed. He said he woke overnight to a cry from Nikki and found she had fallen off the bed. Roberson kept her awake a while longer, he said, before they fell back asleep. When he woke later that morning, she was unresponsive.
Roberson’s supporters say Nikki, a sickly child who visited the doctor’s office or emergency room dozens of times in her short life, had undiagnosed pneumonia. Other complications – including prescribed medicine they say further suppressed Nikki’s breathing – caused the symptoms doctors used to diagnose abuse, Roberson’s attorneys say.
Shaken baby syndrome is now considered a type of abusive head trauma , a broader term that emerged around 2009 to reflect it can be caused by actions other than shaking, like impacts to a child’s head. It is a leading cause of child abuse deaths for children under 5, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Roberson’s attorneys and medical experts they cite say the evidence shows he did not shake his child, nor beat her, as the state has claimed .  On Thursday, Sween called those allegations “grotesque falsehoods,” pointing in part to CT scans discovered only in 2018 that she says show Nikki had just one bump on the back of her head.
Suspicion of Roberson was fueled further, his attorneys say, because of his undiagnosed autism. Medical staff at the hospital and police misjudged his demeanor as uncaring and evidence of guilt, his attorneys say, arguing his behavior is explained by his 2018 autism diagnosis.
“I always in my life, I knew I was different, but I never was diagnosed,” Roberson said.
Former Palestine, Texas, detective Brian Wharton has told CNN the guidance of doctors and Roberson’s demeanor led investigators to focus on the abuse allegations without considering other possibilities.
There is no timeline for Roberson’s trial court to review his case, Sween told reporters in a virtual news conference Thursday. But she is “determined to push this as fast as possible.”
“Robert has been waiting for 23 years already,” she said, noting she has already reached out to the attorney general’s office in hopes of scheduling a hearing.
Thursday’s ruling was celebrated by Roberson’s supporters, who in recent weeks reprised last year’s campaign to save his life. His supporters include Wharton, parents wrongfully convicted of child abuse, medical and forensic experts, advocates for the autism community and the Texas lawmakers who stopped his execution last year – staunch, pro-death penalty conservatives among them.
Republican Rep. Lacey Hull, a supporter of the death penalty, said Wednesday if he was executed, “justice will not be served at all.”
“It would be a stain on this state, a stain on this nation,” she said at a news conference.
On Wednesday, Roberson thought back to last year, when he was pacing back and forth in a cell, moments from being put to death.
“I asked the Lord in to intervene. ‘Please have mercy and grace on me and … please help me,’” he said. He had already packed his belongings on death row in Livingston, Texas, and made the hour-long journey to Huntsville, where the execution chamber sits. He’d had his last meal, pasta with meat sauce.
Last year’s stay, he said, was a “miracle,” he told CNN.
Still, “I was hoping to be home by now,” he said.
